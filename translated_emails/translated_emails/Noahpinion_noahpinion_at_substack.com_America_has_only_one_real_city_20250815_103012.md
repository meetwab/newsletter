Americans who go to Tokyo or Paris or Seoul or London are often wowed by the efficient train systems, dense housing, and walkable city streets lined with shops and restaurants. And yet in these countries, many secondary cities also have these attractive features. Go to Nagoya or Fukuoka, and the trains will be almost as convenient, the houses almost as dense, and the streets almost as attractive as in Tokyo.  
去东京、巴黎、首尔或伦敦的美国人常常对高效的火车系统、密集的住房以及沿街商店和餐馆的步行街感到惊叹。然而在这些国家，许多次要城市也具备这些吸引人的特点。去名古屋或福冈，火车几乎同样便利，房屋几乎同样密集，街道几乎同样迷人，和东京不相上下。

The U.S. is very different. We have New York City, and that’s about it. People from Chicago or Boston may protest that their own cities are also walkable, but transit use statistics show just how big the gap is between NYC and everybody else:  
美国则大相径庭。我们只有纽约市，仅此而已。来自芝加哥或波士顿的人可能会抗议他们自己的城市也很适合步行，但交通使用统计数据清楚地显示了纽约市与其他城市之间的巨大差距：

Chicago, Boston, and the rest have their old urban cores with a few train lines and some shopping streets. But for the most part, even these cities are car-centric sprawl. You can also see this in the population density numbers; New York simply towers over all the rest:  
芝加哥、波士顿和其他城市都有他们的老城区，配有几条火车线路和一些购物街。但在大多数情况下，即使是这些城市也都是以汽车为中心的城市扩张。你也可以从人口密度的数据中看到这一点；纽约的密度远远高于其他城市：

There’s simply no other town in America that looks and feels like NYC.  
美国根本没有其他城市看起来和感觉像纽约市。

Some of the reasons for this are historical. NYC became a big city before the rise of the mass-market passenger car, so it had to use transit to move people around; many cities, like L.A., Houston, and Phoenix, saw their growth happen later. America’s car-friendly policies, abundant land, and desire for suburban living created the car-centric development pattern that we see in many cities in the West and South today.  
其中一些原因是历史性的。纽约市在大众市场乘用车兴起之前就成为了大城市，因此它不得不利用公共交通来运送人们；许多城市，如洛杉矶、休斯顿和凤凰城，其增长发生得较晚。美国的汽车友好政策、丰富的土地和对郊区生活的渴望，创造了今天我们在西部和南部许多城市中看到的以汽车为中心的发展模式。

But many older cities don’t have this excuse. For example, take Philadelphia. In 1910, NYC was only three times bigger than [Philly](https://substack.com/redirect/18e93274-9b0f-4119-8cbc-415087b936cd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA); by 1960 it was almost four times as big, and by 2010 it was five times as big. In other words, Philadelphia had its big growth spurt earlier than NYC did, but its outcome in terms of walkability and transit is just much weaker, with fewer than 20% of Philadelphians using transit for their commute. Very little of downtown Philly looks like Manhattan.  
但许多老城市没有这个借口。例如，费城。在1910年，纽约市的规模仅是[费城](https://substack.com/redirect/18e93274-9b0f-4119-8cbc-415087b936cd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)的三倍；到1960年，它几乎是费城的四倍，到2010年则是五倍。换句话说，费城的快速增长发生得比纽约市早，但在步行友好性和公共交通方面的结果却要弱得多，使用公共交通通勤的费城人不到20%。费城的市中心几乎没有地方看起来像曼哈顿。

The reason NYC is so much bigger than every other city in America is partly mathematical — every country tends to have one city that towers over the rest in terms of total population. And it’s partly economic — Ed Glaeser has a great [essay](https://substack.com/redirect/b2102691-addc-4caa-9c7e-b415189d9dd5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) on the industrial history of NYC. But those reasons can’t explain why NYC is so much denser than other cities. In fact, because NYC includes such an unusually large percent of its metropolitan area (44%, compared to less than 33% for other major cities), you might naively expect it to be less dense — San Francisco is just the tiny metropolitan core of the Bay Area, while NYC includes Staten Island and other outlying areas. Yet NYC is still far denser than SF or any other large American city.  
纽约市之所以比美国其他城市大得多，部分原因是数学上的 — 每个国家往往有一个城市在人口总数上高于其他城市。部分原因是经济上的 — Ed Glaeser在关于纽约市工业历史的[文章](https://substack.com/redirect/b2102691-addc-4caa-9c7e-b415189d9dd5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)中有很好的论述。但这些原因无法解释为什么纽约市的密度远高于其他城市。事实上，由于纽约市包含了其大都市区中异常大的比例（44%，而其他主要城市不到33%），你可能天真地认为它的密度会更低 — 旧金山只是湾区的小型大都市核心，而纽约市则包括斯塔滕岛和其他边缘地区。然而，纽约市的密度仍然远高于旧金山或其他任何大型美国城市。

The reason NYC is America’s only truly dense large city is due to policy. Other cities have restrictive zoning codes that limit floor-area [ratios](https://substack.com/redirect/bfd28169-2af1-4675-9f47-611b59f89c46?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), impose citywide height limits, impose parking minimums, and restrict certain areas to single-family homes. For example, here’s a map showing just how much of San Francisco’s land (in pink) is zoned to allow only single-family homes:  
纽约市之所以是美国唯一真正密集的大城市，归因于政策。其他城市有限制性的分区法规，限制建筑面积[比率](https://substack.com/redirect/bfd28169-2af1-4675-9f47-611b59f89c46?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)，施加全市高度限制，设定停车最少要求，并限制某些区域为单户住宅。例如，这里有一张地图，显示旧金山有多少土地（粉色部分）被划为仅允许单户住宅：

Keep in mind that this is America’s second-densest big city. New York City really stands alone, in terms of allowing tall buildings.  
请记住，这是美国第二密集的大城市。在允许高层建筑方面，纽约市确实独树一帜。

New York City is also unique in having an extensive subway system. In terms of miles of rail, NYC has more than other cities, but just as important is the shape of the network. NYC’s subway is a dense grid that covers all of Manhattan and much of Brooklyn; other cities tend to have commuter rail systems that connect the city center directly to outlying areas but which aren’t as useful for getting around within the central city. For example, here are train maps for NYC, San Francisco, and Boston:  
纽约市在拥有广泛的地铁系统方面也独具特色。在铁路里程方面，纽约市的铁路里程超过其他城市，但同样重要的是网络的形状。纽约市的地铁是一个密集的网格，覆盖了整个曼哈顿和大部分布鲁克林；其他城市往往有通勤铁路系统，直接将市中心与周边地区连接，但在市中心内部的出行上并不那么方便。例如，以下是纽约市、旧金山和波士顿的火车地图：

American cities are no longer able to build subways. This is partly because we’ve outlawed the cheap methods used to build them:  
美国城市不再能够建设地铁。这部分是因为我们已经禁止了用于廉价建造地铁的方法：

But a lot of it is because of the same problems of low state capacity and excessive citizen [input](https://substack.com/redirect/14805d33-42a1-4fe0-a9a4-354a8b418393?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that block every other construction project in America.  
但很多原因是由于低国家能力和过度的公民[参与](https://substack.com/redirect/14805d33-42a1-4fe0-a9a4-354a8b418393?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)的问题，这些问题阻碍了美国的其他建设项目。

In other words, America has only one New York because no other American city wants to become like New York. Throughout the country, “Manhattanization” is a scary term that gets thrown at any developer who wants to increase density.  
换句话说，美国只有一个纽约，因为没有其他美国城市想要变得像纽约。全国范围内，“曼哈顿化”是一个令人恐惧的术语，任何想要增加密度的开发商都会被贴上这个标签。

And yet the number of Americans who want to live in NYC is not small; it’s huge. NYC 1-bedroom rents have been soaring, even as they stagnate nationwide:  
然而，想要住在纽约市的美国人并不少；这个数字非常庞大。纽约市的一居室租金飙升，即使全国范围内的租金停滞不前：

Someone wants to live in NYC, obviously. Partly that’s because of the enormous consumption benefits for the young wealthy childless [people](https://substack.com/redirect/beda94eb-1f39-42d0-9853-58d062cfd50a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) who love living in cities. And partly that’s because dense cities allow industrial clustering [effects](https://substack.com/redirect/c9d5dae9-db24-4431-a381-0a649e08057d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) — everyone knows that if you want to hire good employees in banking, publishing, corporate law, and so on, it helps to be in NYC.  
显然，有人想住在纽约市。这部分是因为对于那些喜欢住在城市的年轻富有无子女的[人群](https://substack.com/redirect/beda94eb-1f39-42d0-9853-58d062cfd50a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)来说，消费利益巨大。部分原因是密集城市允许工业聚集[效应](https://substack.com/redirect/c9d5dae9-db24-4431-a381-0a649e08057d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) — 每个人都知道，如果你想在银行、出版、公司法律等领域雇佣优秀员工，身处纽约市是有帮助的。

Is one city enough to hold all of the Americans who want to live in big, dense cities, as well as all of the Americans who need to live there for work? It is not. The middle class is being pushed out of [NYC](https://substack.com/redirect/c762464f-7544-4421-b9f7-2bc6c572c900?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) at a rapid clip. Americans are trying to pile into other cities, but NIMBYism isn’t letting those cities build many new houses to accommodate them; as a result, rents in other cities go up faster than [wages](https://substack.com/redirect/c9aaa174-b26f-4ece-a1fe-0edbe9ab19d7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).  
一个城市是否足以容纳所有想要住在大型密集城市的美国人，以及所有因工作需要住在那里的人？显然不够。中产阶级正迅速被挤出[纽约市](https://substack.com/redirect/c762464f-7544-4421-b9f7-2bc6c572c900?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。美国人试图涌入其他城市，但NIMBY主义不允许这些城市建造许多新房来容纳他们；结果，其他城市的租金上涨速度快于[工资](https://substack.com/redirect/c9aaa174-b26f-4ece-a1fe-0edbe9ab19d7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。

America needs more than one NYC. It needs Chicago, Philadelphia, and other big old cities with existing walkable urban cores to step up and Manhattanize themselves, so that the country won’t just have one Manhattan.  
美国需要的不止一个纽约市。它需要芝加哥、费城以及其他拥有现有步行友好城市核心的大城市，来提升自己并实现曼哈顿化，这样国家就不会只有一个曼哈顿。

How can this be done? The first step is simply to adopt NYC-style big floor-area ratios, as well as all the city’s other permissive building policies. Allow more density, and some density will get built.  
这该如何实现？第一步就是简单地采用纽约市风格的大建筑面积比率，以及该市的其他宽松建筑政策。允许更多的密度，那么就会建造出一些密度。

The second thing these cities can do is to build more trains. Because the “cut and cover” policies that build subways cheaply are always very unpopular, this probably also means building elevated trains and surface rail. NIMBYism will have to be overcome, but that’s true of just about anything that anyone wants to get done. Cities should also focus on building trains that allow their residents to get around the city, rather than just get into and out of the city; this means constructing trains in a grid or web pattern.  
这些城市可以做的第二件事是建造更多的火车。因为“切割和覆盖”的政策使地铁廉价建造总是不受欢迎，这可能也意味着建造高架火车和地面铁路。NIMBY主义必须被克服，但这对任何想要完成的事情都是如此。城市还应该专注于建设能够让居民在城市内出行的火车，而不仅仅是进出城市；这意味着以网格或网络的形式建设火车。

Another idea is that if other big cities can reduce crime, their citizens will be less apprehensive about allowing more density and transit. NYC is one of America’s safest big [cities](https://sub
