This is the way the bubble ends. This is the way the bubble ends. This is the way the bubble ends: Not with a pop, but with smog and brownouts.
What? I’ll explain in a minute. But first, a word from MechaHitler.
You’ve probably heard about the problems Elon Musk has been having with Grok, his entry in the artificial intelligence sweepstakes. He keeps trying to stop Grok from giving answers he doesn’t like, for example telling users (correctly) that right-wing violence is more frequent and deadly than left-wing violence. But his efforts to make Grok less woke keep making it racist and [antisemitic](https://substack.com/redirect/358a105f-920d-4169-9803-e628d4e66054?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) instead.
But you may not have heard about the environmental crisis created by xAI, which operates Grok. From [Politico](https://substack.com/redirect/b3cffb0a-260c-42fb-adb0-119691e0f7f8?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) in May:
Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company is belching smog-forming pollution into an area of South Memphis that already leads the state in emergency department visits for asthma.
None of the 35 methane gas turbines that help power xAI’s massive supercomputer is equipped with pollution controls typically required by federal rules.
At the time these turbines were operating without permits. On July 2 Shelby County — overruling local protests — issued [permits](https://substack.com/redirect/be5fd6e8-b53d-441d-949c-824456c3e700?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) for 15 turbines, together with emission standards. But given the history, it’s hard to avoid being skeptical about whether those standards will be honored.
Did I mention that South Memphis is 99.5 percent [Black](https://substack.com/redirect/a0e86938-ab6a-43bb-aa92-cf39ddb0783a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)?
There’s a lot to be said here about environmental protection and the corrupting influence of big money on politics. But for today let’s ask a different question: Why did Musk need to install his own, highly polluting generating capacity to power his data center? Why not just buy power from the grid, like everyone else?
The answer, as I explained [yesterday](https://substack.com/redirect/cfe89cca-8434-4f4b-9ebe-dc44f5148f30?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), is that the grid doesn’t have power to spare; we don’t have nearly enough generating capacity to operate all the data centers being built to run AI. That’s why we’re hearing a lot of talk about requiring data centers to provide their own power. But what Musk is doing to Memphis shows that there are big problems with that solution too.
And that in turn suggests that AI may be a bigger short-term risk to the economy than many realize.
Notice that I said short-term, not long-term. This isn’t about AI causing unemployment by replacing humans. We’re talking instead about the risk of a recession if the current surge in AI-driven investment turns out to be unsustainable.
Like many observers, I see obvious parallels between today’s AI boom and the telecom boom of the late 1990s. (Telecom, not dot-com — overinvestment in fiberoptic networks etc. was a much bigger deal than overvalued websites.)
Then as now, huge amounts of business investment were driven by enthusiasm about an exciting new technology. And the enthusiasm back then was justified! I’ve been watching old Qwest ads about the wonders of fiberoptics, and pretty everything they promised has come to pass. You can in fact check into a grungy hotel with decent wifi and watch practically every movie ever made:
Side question: Why were tech industry ads so much better back in 1999?
But the economic payoff to telecom technology didn’t come fast enough to prevent a huge [bust](https://substack.com/redirect/8aad476d-9a09-4f64-858f-54c5a30ea0c9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) in telecom investment:
And this bust in turn led to a recession and a long period of elevated unemployment:
Fast forward to the present. Recent economic growth has been sluggish — only 1.2 percent at an annual rate during the first half of the year — and AI-related investment has probably been the only thing keeping us above “stall speed,” growth so slow that economic weakness becomes self-reinforcing.
The chart below shows the changes between the fourth quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2025 in real GDP and some of its components. Investment in information processing equipment — which at this point basically means data centers — accounted for more than half of overall growth, more than consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of the economy:
Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis
So the AI boom is really the only thing keeping the economy’s head above water, and you have to be worried about what happens if and when it ends.
So far, so 1999. And as in 1999 you have to worry about whether the technology is really as great as the enthusiasts claim, and even if it is, whether it will generate large profits soon enough to justify today’s massive capital expenditures.
But we also have an additional worry: Will companies spending huge amounts on AI hit the brakes once they realize that they won’t be able to power their data centers?
The point is that the mismatch between the immense amounts of electricity data centers are expecting to use and the generating capacity we’re likely to have isn’t just a problem for the companies sinking hundreds of billions into AI. It’s a threat to the economy as a whole.

This is the way the bubble ends. This is the way the bubble ends. This is the way the bubble ends: Not with a pop, but with smog and brownouts.  
泡沫就这样结束。泡沫就这样结束。泡沫就这样结束：不是以爆裂声，而是以烟雾和停电告终。

What? I’ll explain in a minute. But first, a word from MechaHitler.  
什么？我马上解释。但首先，让我们听听MechaHitler的说法。

You’ve probably heard about the problems Elon Musk has been having with Grok, his entry in the artificial intelligence sweepstakes. He keeps trying to stop Grok from giving answers he doesn’t like, for example telling users (correctly) that right-wing violence is more frequent and deadly than left-wing violence. But his efforts to make Grok less woke keep making it racist and [antisemitic](https://substack.com/redirect/358a105f-920d-4169-9803-e628d4e66054?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) instead.  
你可能听说过埃隆·马斯克在他的人工智能项目Grok上遇到的问题。他不断试图阻止Grok给出他不喜欢的答案，例如正确地告诉用户右翼暴力比左翼暴力更频繁和致命。但他试图让Grok变得不那么“觉醒”的努力反而让它变得种族主义和[反犹太主义](https://substack.com/redirect/358a105f-920d-4169-9803-e628d4e66054?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。

But you may not have heard about the environmental crisis created by xAI, which operates Grok. From [Politico](https://substack.com/redirect/b3cffb0a-260c-42fb-adb0-119691e0f7f8?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) in May:  
但你可能没有听说过由xAI（运营Grok的公司）造成的环境危机。来自[Politico](https://substack.com/redirect/b3cffb0a-260c-42fb-adb0-119691e0f7f8?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)的报道提到：

Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company is belching smog-forming pollution into an area of South Memphis that already leads the state in emergency department visits for asthma.  
埃隆·马斯克的人工智能公司正在向南孟菲斯一个已经在哮喘急诊就诊中位居全州首位的地区排放形成烟雾的污染物。

None of the 35 methane gas turbines that help power xAI’s massive supercomputer is equipped with pollution controls typically required by federal rules.  
帮助为xAI的庞大超级计算机供电的35台甲烷气体涡轮机中没有一台配备联邦法规通常要求的污染控制装置。

At the time these turbines were operating without permits. On July 2 Shelby County — overruling local protests — issued [permits](https://substack.com/redirect/be5fd6e8-b53d-441d-949c-824456c3e700?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) for 15 turbines, together with emission standards. But given the history, it’s hard to avoid being skeptical about whether those standards will be honored.  
当时，这些涡轮机是在没有许可证的情况下运行的。7月2日，谢尔比县——推翻当地抗议——为15台涡轮机发放了[许可证](https://substack.com/redirect/be5fd6e8-b53d-441d-949c-824456c3e700?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)，并制定了排放标准。但考虑到历史，很难不对这些标准是否会得到遵守表示怀疑。

Did I mention that South Memphis is 99.5 percent [Black](https://substack.com/redirect/a0e86938-ab6a-43bb-aa92-cf39ddb0783a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)?  
我提到过南孟菲斯的黑人比例达到99.5%吗？[黑人](https://substack.com/redirect/a0e86938-ab6a-43bb-aa92-cf39ddb0783a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)？

There’s a lot to be said here about environmental protection and the corrupting influence of big money on politics. But for today let’s ask a different question: Why did Musk need to install his own, highly polluting generating capacity to power his data center? Why not just buy power from the grid, like everyone else?  
在这里有很多关于环境保护和大金钱对政治腐蚀影响的讨论。但今天我们来问一个不同的问题：为什么马斯克需要安装自己高度污染的发电能力来为他的数据中心供电？为什么不和其他人一样直接从电网购买电力？

The answer, as I explained [yesterday](https://substack.com/redirect/cfe89cca-8434-4f4b-9ebe-dc44f5148f30?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), is that the grid doesn’t have power to spare; we don’t have nearly enough generating capacity to operate all the data centers being built to run AI. That’s why we’re hearing a lot of talk about requiring data centers to provide their own power. But what Musk is doing to Memphis shows that there are big problems with that solution too.  
正如我在[昨天](https://substack.com/redirect/cfe89cca-8434-4f4b-9ebe-dc44f5148f30?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)所解释的，电网没有多余的电力；我们几乎没有足够的发电能力来运营所有为运行人工智能而建造的数据中心。这就是为什么我们听到很多关于要求数据中心提供自己的电力的讨论。但马斯克在孟菲斯所做的事情表明，这个解决方案也存在很大问题。

And that in turn suggests that AI may be a bigger short-term risk to the economy than many realize.  
这反过来又表明，人工智能可能是对经济的一个更大短期风险，超出了许多人的认识。

Notice that I said short-term, not long-term. This isn’t about AI causing unemployment by replacing humans. We’re talking instead about the risk of a recession if the current surge in AI-driven investment turns out to be unsustainable.  
请注意，我说的是短期，而不是长期。这并不是说人工智能通过取代人类导致失业。我们讨论的是，如果当前的人工智能驱动投资激增被证明是不可持续的，那么经济衰退的风险。

Like many observers, I see obvious parallels between today’s AI boom and the telecom boom of the late 1990s. (Telecom, not dot-com — overinvestment in fiberoptic networks etc. was a much bigger deal than overvalued websites.)  
像许多观察者一样，我看到今天的人工智能热潮与1990年代末的电信热潮之间有明显的相似之处。（电信，而不是互联网泡沫——对光纤网络等的过度投资远比对高估的网站更为重要。）

Then as now, huge amounts of business investment were driven by enthusiasm about an exciting new technology. And the enthusiasm back then was justified! I’ve been watching old Qwest ads about the wonders of fiberoptics, and pretty everything they promised has come to pass. You can in fact check into a grungy hotel with decent wifi and watch practically every movie ever made:  
当时和现在一样，大量的商业投资都是由对令人兴奋的新技术的热情驱动的。而当时的热情是有道理的！我一直在观看关于光纤奇迹的老Qwest广告，他们所承诺的几乎都已实现。实际上，你可以在一家有不错wifi的破旧酒店入住，并观看几乎所有制作过的电影：

Side question: Why were tech industry ads so much better back in 1999?  
附带问题：为什么1999年的科技行业广告要好得多？

But the economic payoff to telecom technology didn’t come fast enough to prevent a huge [bust](https://substack.com/redirect/8aad476d-9a09-4f64-858f-54c5a30ea0c9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) in telecom investment:  
但电信技术的经济回报并没有迅速到来，以至于无法阻止电信投资的巨大[崩溃](https://substack.com/redirect/8aad476d-9a09-4f64-858f-54c5a30ea0c9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)：

And this bust in turn led to a recession and a long period of elevated unemployment:  
而这次崩溃又导致了经济衰退和长期的高失业率：

Fast forward to the present. Recent economic growth has been sluggish — only 1.2 percent at an annual rate during the first half of the year — and AI-related investment has probably been the only thing keeping us above “stall speed,” growth so slow that economic weakness becomes self-reinforcing.  
快进到现在。最近的经济增长一直很缓慢——在上半年的年增长率仅为1.2%——而与人工智能相关的投资可能是唯一让我们保持在“停滞速度”之上的因素，增长如此缓慢，以至于经济疲软变得自我强化。

The chart below shows the changes between the fourth quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2025 in real GDP and some of its components. Investment in information processing equipment — which at this point basically means data centers — accounted for more than half of overall growth, more than consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of the economy:  
下图显示了2024年第四季度和2025年第二季度之间实际GDP及其某些组成部分的变化。信息处理设备的投资——在这一点上基本上意味着数据中心——占整体增长的一半以上，超过了消费支出，而消费支出占经济的70%：

So the AI boom is really the only thing keeping the economy’s head above water, and you have to be worried about what happens if and when it ends.  
因此，人工智能热潮实际上是唯一让经济保持浮动的因素，你必须担心它结束时会发生什么。

So far, so 1999. And as in 1999 you have to worry about whether the technology is really as great as the enthusiasts claim, and even if it is, whether it will generate large profits soon enough to justify today’s massive capital expenditures.  
到目前为止，一切都像1999年一样。正如在1999年一样，你必须担心这项技术是否真的像热衷者所声称的那样伟大，即使它确实如此，它是否会在足够快的时间内产生足够的利润，以证明今天的巨大资本支出。

But we also have an additional worry: Will companies spending huge amounts on AI hit the brakes once they realize that they won’t be able to power their data centers?  
但我们还有一个额外的担忧：一旦公司意识到他们无法为数据中心提供电力，花费巨额资金在人工智能上的公司会不会踩刹车？

The point is that the mismatch between the immense amounts of electricity data centers are expecting to use and the generating capacity we’re likely to have isn’t just a problem for the companies sinking hundreds of billions into AI. It’s a threat to the economy as a whole.  
关键在于，数据中心预计使用的巨量电力与我们可能拥有的发电能力之间的不匹配，不仅仅是投入数千亿美元于人工智能的公司的问题。这是对整个经济的威胁。
