I’ve got quite a few great podcasts for you today. One is this excellent live show that Erik Torenberg and I did with Dwarkesh Patel, in which we interview Dwarkesh about his thoughts on AI and the economy. The picture of me here is quite silly-looking, but the conversation was excellent:  
我今天有几个很棒的播客推荐给你们。其中一个是我和Erik Torenberg与Dwarkesh Patel进行的精彩直播节目，我们采访Dwarkesh，讨论他对人工智能和经济的看法。这里我的照片看起来很傻，但对话非常精彩：

I also went on Pascal-emmanuel Gobry’s podcast to debate him about illegal immigration:  
我还参加了Pascal-emmanuel Gobry的播客，与他辩论非法移民问题：

And some Japanese media folks at a company called Glasp interviewed me about AI and jobs, and about foreign direct investment in Japan!  
还有一些来自一家名为Glasp的日本媒体的朋友采访了我，讨论人工智能与就业，以及外国直接投资在日本的情况！

Finally, here’s an episode of Econ 102, where Erik and I discuss Javier Milei and various other topics:  
最后，这里有一集Econ 102，Erik和我讨论了哈维尔·米莱和其他各种话题：

Anyway, on to the roundup!  
好了，接下来是总结！

1. It doesn’t look like AI is taking jobs yet  
1. 看起来人工智能还没有取代工作

It’s practically conventional wisdom that AI is going to take jobs away from large numbers of humans, leaving them without anything useful to do in the economy. People are so convinced of this that they’ll jump at practically any hint in the data that allows them to believe that it’s happening. A little while ago I wrote a post about why both economists and popular commentators are getting way over their skis on this:  
几乎已经成为共识，人工智能将会夺走大量人类的工作，让他们在经济中无所事事。人们对此深信不疑，以至于他们会对数据中任何暗示这一现象的线索跃跃欲试。前一段时间，我写了一篇文章，讨论为什么经济学家和流行评论员在这方面过于乐观：

Anyway, Sarah Eckhardt and Nathan Goldschlag of the Economic Innovation Group have a good new report on this, which shows that as far as we can tell, AI isn’t taking jobs yet — at least, not on any measurable scale.  
无论如何，经济创新小组的Sarah Eckhardt和Nathan Goldschlag对此有一份很好的新报告，显示就我们所知，人工智能还没有取代工作——至少在任何可衡量的规模上都没有。

Eckhardt and Goldschlag start with a [measure](https://substack.com/redirect/22121ff2-6a53-4107-8b63-ad818fa923aa?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) of predicted AI exposure for various jobs. These measures don’t tell you which jobs are going to be replaced by AI; instead, they just tell you which jobs currently involve more tasks that can probably be done by AI. These measures actually have a pretty good track [record](https://substack.com/redirect/e880a837-e33c-4539-9b41-544985fc8c22?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) at predicting which workers will end up using AI.  
Eckhardt和Goldschlag首先使用了一个关于各种工作的[预测](https://substack.com/redirect/22121ff2-6a53-4107-8b63-ad818fa923aa?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)人工智能暴露度的指标。这些指标并不能告诉你哪些工作将被人工智能取代；相反，它们只是告诉你哪些工作目前涉及更多可能由人工智能完成的任务。这些指标在预测哪些工人最终会使用人工智能方面实际上有相当不错的[记录](https://substack.com/redirect/e880a837-e33c-4539-9b41-544985fc8c22?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。

Basically, Eckhardt and Goldschlag find no correlation — or even a negative correlation — between that measure of AI exposure and any measure of labor market distress. For example, here’s the unemployment rate of workers with varying degrees of predicted AI exposure (1 is the least exposed, 5 is the most exposed):  
基本上，Eckhardt和Goldschlag发现人工智能暴露度的指标与任何劳动市场困境的指标之间没有相关性——甚至是负相关性。例如，以下是不同程度的预测人工智能暴露的工人的失业率（1是最低暴露，5是最高暴露）：

There has been a recent rise in unemployment, but it’s concentrated among the people who are least exposed to AI, while those who are the most exposed almost all still have jobs. The same is true when we look only at recent college graduates, who have been the focus of the most concern in the media:  
最近失业率有所上升，但这主要集中在那些对人工智能暴露最少的人群中，而那些暴露最多的人几乎都仍然有工作。对于最近的大学毕业生也是如此，他们一直是媒体最关注的焦点：

And the same is true when we look at which workers are exiting the labor force completely:  
当我们观察哪些工人完全退出劳动力市场时情况也是如此：

And one more interesting finding is that the most-exposed workers are actually less likely to switch to less-exposed occupations than they were before generative AI hit the market! In other words, coders and paper-pushers are not becoming plumbers to protect themselves from AI:  
还有一个有趣的发现是，暴露最多的工人实际上比生成性人工智能进入市场之前更不可能转向暴露较少的职业！换句话说，程序员和文员并没有转行去当水管工以保护自己免受人工智能的影响：

The researchers also try using alternative measures of AI exposure, and they find pretty much the same thing.  
研究人员还尝试使用其他人工智能暴露度的指标，结果发现几乎是相同的。

In other words, AI job displacement just hasn’t happened yet. It may happen in the future, but so far, every time people have jumped at a particular data point to claim it’s finally happening, it has turned out to be a mirage.  
换句话说，人工智能工作替代尚未发生。它可能在未来发生，但到目前为止，每当人们对某个特定数据点跃跃欲试，声称这终于发生时，结果都证明这只是海市蜃楼。

2. Bernie’s bad chart  
2. 伯尼的糟糕图表

Bernie Sanders and his followers deeply believe that America’s economy is in a prolonged state of crisis — that capitalist economic policies have steadily immiserated the American public, creating a country where regular people are economically drowning even as corporate fat cats enrich themselves. Their absolute faith in this narrative often leads them to interpret economic statistics in dubious or even ridiculous ways. The latest example of this is when Bernie Sanders posted a chart of housing versus wages:  
伯尼·桑德斯及其追随者深信美国经济处于长期危机状态——资本主义经济政策不断使美国公众陷入困境，造成一个普通人在经济上窘迫，而企业巨头却在不断致富的国家。他们对这一叙述的绝对信任常常导致他们以可疑甚至荒谬的方式解读经济统计数据。最近的一个例子是伯尼·桑德斯发布了一张住房与工资的图表：

This is a pretty ridiculous chart. Why would you plot home prices on the same y-axis as weekly income? Does anyone think these two things should be even remotely close to the same size? Do we think people should be able to afford a house on a single week of income? That’s ridiculous.  
这是一张相当荒谬的图表。为什么要将房价与周收入绘制在同一个y轴上？有人认为这两者应该有任何相近的大小吗？我们认为人们应该能够用一周的收入买得起房子吗？这太荒谬了。

A non-ridiculous way to present this data would be to divide home prices by weekly earnings. That would show us how many weeks a typical worker would need to work in order to afford a home. But actually, the “median weekly earnings” number is for full-time workers only, so instead we should use median personal income, which counts everybody. Here’s what that looks like:  
一种不荒谬的呈现数据的方式是将房价除以周收入。这将告诉我们一个典型工人需要工作多少周才能买得起房子。但实际上，“中位数周收入”这个数字仅适用于全职工人，因此我们应该使用中位数个人收入，这样可以计算所有人。以下是这样的结果：

In the 80s and 90s, it took about 8 years of work to afford a home. Since then, the number has climbed to about 10 years — a significant and concerning drop in affordability, but not a catastrophic drop. A breakdown by the Economic Innovation Group shows that mortgages are about as affordable as they ever were, but down payments have gotten less affordable:  
在80年代和90年代，买得起一套房子大约需要8年的工作时间。自那以来，这个数字上升到大约10年——这在可负担性上是一个显著且令人担忧的下降，但并不是灾难性的下降。经济创新小组的分析显示，抵押贷款的可负担性与以往差不多，但首付款的可负担性下降了：

While the drop in housing affordability over the past half century is certainly a problem, it’s not the kind of crisis that Bernie paints it as. Using silly charts in service of alarmist narratives ultimately just weakens trust in your movement — or at least, it should.  
虽然过去半个世纪住房可负担性的下降确实是个问题，但这并不是伯尼所描绘的那种危机。使用愚蠢的图表来服务于危言耸听的叙述，最终只会削弱人们对你们运动的信任——或者至少应该如此。

3. Personalist dictatorships are probably bad for the economy  
3. 个人主义独裁可能对经济不利

The three most powerful countries in the world are now all ruled by strongmen. In China, Xi Jinping has subdued all rivals, and concentrated what used to be a dispersed bureaucratic oligarchy under his own personal [rule](https://substack.com/redirect/31cb2199-e820-4cfe-89d1-f055caa6e07a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). In Russia, Putin is effectively an emperor. The U.S. is still officially a democracy, but democratic norms and institutions are eroding rapidly, and in April a majority of Americans called Trump a “dictator” [ https://substack.com/redirect/802c3dcb-9570-4e6d-aec8-3bef0fbda59d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA ].  
世界上最强大的三个国家现在都由强人统治。在中国，习近平已经压制了所有对手，将曾经分散的官僚寡头统治集中在他个人的[统治](https://substack.com/redirect/31cb2199-e820-4cfe-89d1-f055caa6e07a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)之下。在俄罗斯，普京实际上是一个皇帝。美国仍然官方是一个民主国家，但民主规范和制度正在迅速侵蚀，四月份大多数美国人称特朗普为“独裁者”[ https://substack.com/redirect/802c3dcb-9570-4e6d-aec8-3bef0fbda59d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA ]。

The question is what effect these personalistic regimes will have on the economy. China’s growth over the past four decades pretty much proves that democracy isn’t necessary for a strong or even dominant economy. But there’s a difference between countries ruled by a single strongman, and countries ruled by a system of elite institutions that distribute power among a number of oligarchs.  
问题是这些个人主义政权将对经济产生什么影响。过去四十年中国的增长几乎证明了民主并不是强大甚至主导经济所必需的。但由单一强人统治的国家与由一套精英机构统治、在多个寡头之间分配权力的国家之间是有区别的。

A new paper by Blattman, Gehlbach, and [Yu](https://substack.com/redirect/5ad148ca-2752-4440-8608-dd245b8e8bfe?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) shows that personalist regimes tend to experience lower economic growth than either democracies or autocracies with more distributed power. The difference isn’t huge, but you can see it on a graph:  
Blattman、Gehlbach和[Yu](https://substack.com/redirect/5ad148ca-2752-4440-8608-dd245b8e8bfe?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)的一项新论文显示，个人主义政权的经济增长往往低于民主国家或权力分散的独裁国家。这个差异并不大，但你可以在图表中看到：

It’s not clear which direction the causation runs here; it could be that countries with bad economies tend to turn to strongmen to save them. But Blattman et al. test for this using variables that tend to predict regime transitions, and they don’t find any change. That implies that personalist regimes actually make mistakes that slow down economic growth.  
这里因果关系的方向并不明确；可能是经济不好的国家倾向于转向强人来拯救他们。但Blattman等人使用倾向于预测政权过渡的变量进行测试，结果没有发现任何变化。这意味着个人主义政权实际上犯下了减缓经济增长的错误。

Xi, Putin, and Trump certainly don’t exactly seem to be violating that rule of thumb. China’s growth has slowed relentlessly under Xi, and his industrial policy seems to be simply driving Chinese companies into [unprofitability](https://substack.com/redirect/b87eb2e9-ff2d-4e4b-86a1-9b01d45cefcd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) rather than extricating the country from its economic [slump](https://substack.com/redirect/ac158bf5-6ecb-4f8d-8525-8c982be7264d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Putin’s war in Ukraine is slowly crushing the [life](https://substack.com/redirect/9da512e8-6c29-4937-aab2-121d0c8048c8?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) out of the Russian economy, while Trump’s tariffs continue to wear [down](https://substack.com/redirect/1ad52afe-24ed-4127-86b8-5451beb093e7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) the resilient U.S. economy.  
习近平、普京和特朗普显然并没有违反这一经验法则。在习近平的领导下，中国的增长持续放缓，他的工业政策似乎只是将中国公司推向[亏损](https://
