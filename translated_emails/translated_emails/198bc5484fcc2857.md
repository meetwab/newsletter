During the Biden years, I [wrote](https://substack.com/redirect/10f68a50-c602-4929-9dd0-f5d712df21e4?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) a lot [about](https://substack.com/redirect/e2134b34-3324-405c-9985-82a39e0530d4?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) U.S.-China [competition](https://substack.com/redirect/c8db32a6-c1df-4c3f-b2f2-b210e9f37f56?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Like many other analysts, I was pretty convinced that the next decade or two would be shaped by geostrategic, military, technological, and economic competition between these two giant nations and their respective coalitions of allies. This seemed like a reasonable assumption, because of the political actions of the people in charge of the two nations. Xi Jinping seemed dead [set](https://substack.com/redirect/bd1fb863-01b6-40c8-b338-416b7fd25ad7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) on having China supplant the U.S. as the world’s dominant power, while both the first Trump administration and the Biden administration made competition with China a primary policy goal. Export controls, tariffs, industrial policy, and most other economic policy innovations in the U.S. all seemed oriented around the same goal: competing with China. 
Most of the structural preconditions for a Cold War style confrontation seemed in place — territorial flashpoints, intractable ideological and institutional differences, competing tech ecosystems. Opinions of China in the U.S. and elsewhere plunged around [2019](https://substack.com/redirect/e1ad2676-0136-4a6b-8576-ba025d09438d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), adding fuel to the fire. The Ukraine war increasingly felt like a proxy war between China and NATO. On top of all that, we had the Second China [Shock](https://substack.com/redirect/14898691-1995-4ca0-9d18-266dcb29eee3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), as China’s post-pandemic industrial policy flooded the world with cheap goods and threatened manufacturers in every other country. 
When Trump returned to power, many people predicted that the competition between the two countries would intensify. But I was suspicious of that [narrative](https://substack.com/redirect/1dccf208-6caa-4b78-bf33-1aa0d4c46007?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Trump had already come out [against](https://substack.com/redirect/cd2201eb-13e7-43e0-a249-fb6d4427fcc5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) the TikTok divestment bill, and [denounced](https://substack.com/redirect/545dc609-2f21-4d81-8dbd-277d0878e067?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) the Biden-era industrial policies that were giving the U.S. a chance of competing with China in strategic industries like semiconductors and EVs. Furthermore, prominent China hawks like Matt Pottinger seemed to have been purged from the Trump orbit. 
The simplest explanation, in my view, was that Trump had simply chosen to change America’s alignment to a neutral, isolationist [stance](https://substack.com/redirect/dfb2616a-c2b0-487c-8f02-f6413db9f2cd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). He seemed to want to revive Charles Lindbergh’s idea of dividing the world into regional spheres of influence, ceding influence in Asia to China and influence in Europe to Russia. 
After 7 months of the Trump presidency, however, I’m starting to gravitate toward a different theory. It now seems to me that the U.S. and China have simply mutually decided to pause their incipient rivalry in order to focus on domestic issues. In America’s case, this manifests as a combination of popular exhaustion and elite distraction; China, meanwhile, seems to be focusing more on its economic problems.
America isn’t even trying anymore...

Export controls, tariffs, industrial policy, and most other economic policy innovations in the U.S. all seemed oriented around the same goal: competing with China.  
在拜登执政期间，我[写了](https://substack.com/redirect/10f68a50-c602-4929-9dd0-f5d712df21e4?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)很多关于美中[竞争](https://substack.com/redirect/c8db32a6-c1df-4c3f-b2f2-b210e9f37f56?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)的[文章](https://substack.com/redirect/e2134b34-3324-405c-9985-82a39e0530d4?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。和许多其他分析师一样，我相当相信未来十年或二十年将由这两个巨国及其各自的盟友联盟之间的地缘战略、军事、技术和经济竞争所塑造。这似乎是一个合理的假设，因为两国领导人的政治行为。习近平似乎坚决[设定](https://substack.com/redirect/bd1fb863-01b6-40c8-b338-416b7fd25ad7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)了要让中国取代美国成为世界主导力量，而特朗普政府和拜登政府都将与中国的竞争作为主要政策目标。出口管制、关税、产业政策以及美国大多数其他经济政策创新似乎都围绕着同一个目标：与中国竞争。  

Most of the structural preconditions for a Cold War style confrontation seemed in place — territorial flashpoints, intractable ideological and institutional differences, competing tech ecosystems. Opinions of China in the U.S. and elsewhere plunged around [2019](https://substack.com/redirect/e1ad2676-0136-4a6b-8576-ba025d09438d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), adding fuel to the fire. The Ukraine war increasingly felt like a proxy war between China and NATO. On top of all that, we had the Second China [Shock](https://substack.com/redirect/14898691-1995-4ca0-9d18-266dcb29eee3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), as China’s post-pandemic industrial policy flooded the world with cheap goods and threatened manufacturers in every other country.  
冷战式对抗的主要结构性前提似乎都已具备——领土冲突、难以调和的意识形态和制度差异、竞争的技术生态系统。2019年左右，美国及其他地方对中国的看法急剧下降，火上浇油。乌克兰战争越来越像是中国与北约之间的代理战争。除此之外，我们还经历了第二次中国[冲击](https://substack.com/redirect/14898691-1995-4ca0-9d18-266dcb29eee3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)，因为中国的后疫情产业政策向全球倾销廉价商品，威胁到其他国家的制造商。  

When Trump returned to power, many people predicted that the competition between the two countries would intensify. But I was suspicious of that [narrative](https://substack.com/redirect/1dccf208-6caa-4b78-bf33-1aa0d4c46007?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Trump had already come out [against](https://substack.com/redirect/cd2201eb-13e7-43e0-a249-fb6d4427fcc5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) the TikTok divestment bill, and [denounced](https://substack.com/redirect/545dc609-2f21-4d81-8dbd-277d0878e067?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) the Biden-era industrial policies that were giving the U.S. a chance of competing with China in strategic industries like semiconductors and EVs. Furthermore, prominent China hawks like Matt Pottinger seemed to have been purged from the Trump orbit.  
当特朗普重新掌权时，许多人预测两国之间的竞争将加剧。但我对这种[叙述](https://substack.com/redirect/1dccf208-6caa-4b78-bf33-1aa0d4c46007?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)持怀疑态度。特朗普已经公开[反对](https://substack.com/redirect/cd2201eb-13e7-43e0-a249-fb6d4427fcc5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)TikTok剥离法案，并[谴责](https://substack.com/redirect/545dc609-2f21-4d81-8dbd-277d0878e067?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)拜登时代的产业政策，这些政策让美国在半导体和电动汽车等战略产业中有机会与中国竞争。此外，像马特·波廷杰这样的著名中国鹰派似乎已经被特朗普的圈子清除。  

The simplest explanation, in my view, was that Trump had simply chosen to change America’s alignment to a neutral, isolationist [stance](https://substack.com/redirect/dfb2616a-c2b0-487c-8f02-f6413db9f2cd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). He seemed to want to revive Charles Lindbergh’s idea of dividing the world into regional spheres of influence, ceding influence in Asia to China and influence in Europe to Russia.  
在我看来，最简单的解释是，特朗普选择将美国的立场转变为中立的、孤立主义的[姿态](https://substack.com/redirect/dfb2616a-c2b0-487c-8f02-f6413db9f2cd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。他似乎想要复兴查尔斯·林德伯gh的思想，将世界划分为区域性势力范围，将亚洲的影响力让给中国，将欧洲的影响力让给俄罗斯。  

After 7 months of the Trump presidency, however, I’m starting to gravitate toward a different theory. It now seems to me that the U.S. and China have simply mutually decided to pause their incipient rivalry in order to focus on domestic issues. In America’s case, this manifests as a combination of popular exhaustion and elite distraction; China, meanwhile, seems to be focusing more on its economic problems.  
然而，在特朗普总统任期的7个月后，我开始倾向于另一种理论。现在我觉得，美国和中国似乎只是相互决定暂停他们初露端倪的竞争，以便专注于国内问题。在美国，这表现为民众的疲惫和精英的分心；而中国似乎则更加专注于其经济问题。  

America isn’t even trying anymore...  
美国甚至不再努力了……
