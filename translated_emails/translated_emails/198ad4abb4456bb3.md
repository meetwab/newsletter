Americans who go to Tokyo or Paris or Seoul or London are often wowed by the efficient train systems, dense housing, and walkable city streets lined with shops and restaurants. And yet in these countries, many secondary cities also have these attractive features. Go to Nagoya or Fukuoka, and the trains will be almost as convenient, the houses almost as dense, and the streets almost as attractive as in Tokyo. 
The U.S. is very different. We have New York City, and that’s about it. People from Chicago or Boston may protest that their own cities are also walkable, but transit use statistics show just how big the gap is between NYC and everybody else:
Chicago, Boston, and the rest have their old urban cores with a few train lines and some shopping streets. But for the most part, even these cities are car-centric sprawl. You can also see this in the population density numbers; New York simply towers over all the rest:
There’s simply no other town in America that looks and feels like NYC. 
Some of the reasons for this are historical. NYC became a big city before the rise of the mass-market passenger car, so it had to use transit to move people around; many cities, like L.A., Houston, and Phoenix, saw their growth happen later. America’s car-friendly policies, abundant land, and desire for suburban living created the car-centric development pattern that we see in many cities in the West and South today. 
But many older cities don’t have this excuse. For example, take Philadelphia. In 1910, NYC was only three times bigger than [Philly](https://substack.com/redirect/18e93274-9b0f-4119-8cbc-415087b936cd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA); by 1960 it was almost four times as big, and by 2010 it was five times as big. In other words, Philadelphia had its big growth spurt earlier than NYC did, but its outcome in terms of walkability and transit is just much weaker, with fewer than 20% of Philadelphians using transit for their commute. Very little of downtown Philly looks like Manhattan.
The reason NYC is so much bigger than every other city in America is partly mathematical — every country tends to have one city that towers over the rest in terms of total population. And it’s partly economic — Ed Glaeser has a great [essay](https://substack.com/redirect/b2102691-addc-4caa-9c7e-b415189d9dd5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) on the industrial history of NYC. But those reasons can’t explain why NYC is so much denser than other cities. In fact, because NYC includes such an unusually large percent of its metropolitan area (44%, compared to less than 33% for other major cities), you might naively expect it to be less dense — San Francisco is just the tiny metropolitan core of the Bay Area, while NYC includes Staten Island and other outlying areas. Yet NYC is still far denser than SF or any other large American city. 
The reason NYC is America’s only truly dense large city is due to policy. Other cities have restrictive zoning codes that limit floor-area [ratios](https://substack.com/redirect/bfd28169-2af1-4675-9f47-611b59f89c46?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), impose citywide height limits, impose parking minimums, and restrict certain areas to single-family homes. For example, here’s a map showing just how much of San Francisco’s land (in pink) is zoned to allow only single-family homes:
Keep in mind that this is America’s second-densest big city. New York City really stands alone, in terms of allowing tall buildings. 
New York City is also unique in having an extensive subway system. In terms of miles of rail, NYC has more than other cities, but just as important is the shape of the network. NYC’s subway is a dense grid that covers all of Manhattan and much of Brooklyn; other cities tend to have commuter rail systems that connect the city center directly to outlying areas but which aren’t as useful for getting around within the central city. For example, here are train maps for NYC, San Francisco, and Boston:
American cities are no longer able to build subways. This is partly because we’ve outlawed the cheap methods used to build them:
But a lot of it is because of the same problems of low state capacity and excessive citizen [input](https://substack.com/redirect/14805d33-42a1-4fe0-a9a4-354a8b418393?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that block every other construction project in America. 
In other words, America has only one New York because no other American city wants to become like New York. Throughout the country, “Manhattanization” is a scary term that gets thrown at any developer who wants to increase density. 
And yet the number of Americans who want to live in NYC is not small; it’s huge. NYC 1-bedroom rents have been soaring, even as they stagnate nationwide:
Someone wants to live in NYC, obviously. Partly that’s because of the enormous consumption benefits for the young wealthy childless [people](https://substack.com/redirect/beda94eb-1f39-42d0-9853-58d062cfd50a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) who love living in cities. And partly that’s because dense cities allow industrial clustering [effects](https://substack.com/redirect/c9d5dae9-db24-4431-a381-0a649e08057d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) — everyone knows that if you want to hire good employees in banking, publishing, corporate law, and so on, it helps to be in NYC. 
Is one city enough to hold all of the Americans who want to live in big, dense cities, as well as all of the Americans who need to live there for work? It is not. The middle class is being pushed out of [NYC](https://substack.com/redirect/c762464f-7544-4421-b9f7-2bc6c572c900?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) at a rapid clip. Americans are trying to pile into other cities, but NIMBYism isn’t letting those cities build many new houses to accommodate them; as a result, rents in other cities go up faster than [wages](https://substack.com/redirect/c9aaa174-b26f-4ece-a1fe-0edbe9ab19d7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).
America needs more than one NYC. It needs Chicago, Philadelphia, and other big old cities with existing walkable urban cores to step up and Manhattanize themselves, so that the country won’t just have one Manhattan.
How can this be done? The first step is simply to adopt NYC-style big floor-area ratios, as well as all the city’s other permissive building policies. Allow more density, and some density will get built. 
The second thing these cities can do is to build more trains. Because the “cut and cover” policies that build subways cheaply are always very unpopular, this probably also means building elevated trains and surface rail. NIMBYism will have to be overcome, but that’s true of just about anything that anyone wants to get done. Cities should also focus on building trains that allow their residents to get around the city, rather than just get into and out of the city; this means constructing trains in a grid or web pattern. 
Another idea is that if other big cities can reduce crime, their citizens will be less apprehensive about allowing more density and transit. NYC is one of America’s safest big [cities](https://substack.com/redirect/ca81412c-23d0-437f-8911-f4307b0c87d6?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), with a homicide of less than 4 per 100,000 population as of 2024. Chicago, in contrast, was at 17.5, and Philadelphia at 16.9. San Francisco has a fairly low homicide rate of 6.4, but it still has a big problem of public [disorder](https://substack.com/redirect/1c60772c-839f-4724-9d85-c3cd4827c36b?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), including fentanyl use, homeless encampments, store raids, and general lawlessness. Reducing this public disorder — as well as crime in general — would make it far more appealing to live in a dense area, to walk down shop-lined streets, to take the train, and so on. 
Some Americans instinctively recoil from calls to make more cities like NYC. They prefer their single-family homes, their cars, their strip-malls and lawns. Fine. But those people should consider that if America had one or two more New York-style cities, the people who want to live in that sort of city would move there, freeing up more space for everyone else. 
The U.S. needs both dense cities and suburbs, in order to satisfy all the different Americans who want different lifestyles. We are overweight on Los Angeles type cities, and underweight on NYC type cities. We need to restore balance, by converting more of our big old cities into gleaming new Manhattans.

Americans who go to Tokyo or Paris or Seoul or London are often wowed by the efficient train systems, dense housing, and walkable city streets lined with shops and restaurants. And yet in these countries, many secondary cities also have these attractive features. Go to Nagoya or Fukuoka, and the trains will be almost as convenient, the houses almost as dense, and the streets almost as attractive as in Tokyo.  
去东京、巴黎、首尔或伦敦的美国人常常对高效的火车系统、密集的住房和两旁布满商店和餐馆的步行街感到惊叹。然而在这些国家，许多次要城市也具备这些吸引人的特点。去名古屋或福冈，火车几乎同样方便，房屋几乎同样密集，街道几乎同样迷人，和东京相比。

The U.S. is very different. We have New York City, and that’s about it. People from Chicago or Boston may protest that their own cities are also walkable, but transit use statistics show just how big the gap is between NYC and everybody else:  
美国则大不相同。我们只有纽约市，其他的就差不多了。来自芝加哥或波士顿的人可能会抗议，认为他们自己的城市也很适合步行，但交通使用统计数据显示，纽约市与其他城市之间的差距有多大：

Chicago, Boston, and the rest have their old urban cores with a few train lines and some shopping streets. But for the most part, even these cities are car-centric sprawl. You can also see this in the population density numbers; New York simply towers over all the rest:  
芝加哥、波士顿和其他城市都有他们的老城区，配有几条火车线路和一些购物街。但大多数情况下，即使是这些城市也以汽车为中心，呈现出城市蔓延的现象。你也可以从人口密度的数据中看到这一点；纽约在所有城市中显得格外高大：

There’s simply no other town in America that looks and feels like NYC.  
美国根本没有其他城市看起来和感觉像纽约市。

Some of the reasons for this are historical. NYC became a big city before the rise of the mass-market passenger car, so it had to use transit to move people around; many cities, like L.A., Houston, and Phoenix, saw their growth happen later. America’s car-friendly policies, abundant land, and desire for suburban living created the car-centric development pattern that we see in many cities in the West and South today.  
这其中的一些原因是历史性的。纽约市在大众市场乘用车兴起之前就成为了大城市，因此它必须使用公共交通来移动人群；而许多城市，如洛杉矶、休斯顿和凤凰城，增长发生得较晚。美国的汽车友好政策、丰富的土地和对郊区生活的渴望，创造了我们今天在西部和南部许多城市中看到的以汽车为中心的发展模式。

But many older cities don’t have this excuse. For example, take Philadelphia. In 1910, NYC was only three times bigger than [Philly](https://substack.com/redirect/18e93274-9b0f-4119-8cbc-415087b936cd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA); by 1960 it was almost four times as big, and by 2010 it was five times as big. In other words, Philadelphia had its big growth spurt earlier than NYC did, but its outcome in terms of walkability and transit is just much weaker, with fewer than 20% of Philadelphians using transit for their commute. Very little of downtown Philly looks like Manhattan.  
但许多老城市并没有这个借口。例如，费城。在1910年，纽约市的规模仅是[费城](https://substack.com/redirect/18e93274-9b0f-4119-8cbc-415087b936cd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)的三倍；到1960年，它几乎是费城的四倍，到2010年，它是费城的五倍。换句话说，费城的快速增长发生在纽约市之前，但在步行性和交通方面的结果却要弱得多，使用公共交通通勤的费城人不到20%。费城的市中心几乎没有地方看起来像曼哈顿。

The reason NYC is so much bigger than every other city in America is partly mathematical — every country tends to have one city that towers over the rest in terms of total population. And it’s partly economic — Ed Glaeser has a great [essay](https://substack.com/redirect/b2102691-addc-4caa-9c7e-b415189d9dd5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) on the industrial history of NYC. But those reasons can’t explain why NYC is so much denser than other cities. In fact, because NYC includes such an unusually large percent of its metropolitan area (44%, compared to less than 33% for other major cities), you might naively expect it to be less dense — San Francisco is just the tiny metropolitan core of the Bay Area, while NYC includes Staten Island and other outlying areas. Yet NYC is still far denser than SF or any other large American city.  
纽约市之所以比美国其他城市大得多，部分原因是数学上的——每个国家往往有一个城市在人口总数上高于其他城市。部分原因则是经济上的——Ed Glaeser在关于纽约市工业历史的[文章](https://substack.com/redirect/b2102691-addc-4caa-9c7e-b415189d9dd5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)中有很好的论述。但这些原因无法解释为什么纽约市的密度远高于其他城市。事实上，由于纽约市包含了其大都市区中异常大的比例（44%，而其他主要城市不到33%），你可能天真地认为它的密度应该更低——旧金山只是湾区的小型大都市核心，而纽约市则包括斯塔滕岛和其他边缘地区。然而，纽约市的密度仍然远高于旧金山或其他大型美国城市。

The reason NYC is America’s only truly dense large city is due to policy. Other cities have restrictive zoning codes that limit floor-area [ratios](https://substack.com/redirect/bfd28169-2af1-4675-9f47-611b59f89c46?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), impose citywide height limits, impose parking minimums, and restrict certain areas to single-family homes. For example, here’s a map showing just how much of San Francisco’s land (in pink) is zoned to allow only single-family homes:  
纽约市是美国唯一一个真正密集的大城市的原因在于政策。其他城市有限制性的区域规划法规，限制建筑面积[比率](https://substack.com/redirect/bfd28169-2af1-4675-9f47-611b59f89c46?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)，施加全市范围的高度限制，设定停车最小标准，并将某些区域限制为单户住宅。例如，这里有一张地图，显示了旧金山有多少土地（粉色部分）被划为仅允许单户住宅：

Keep in mind that this is America’s second-densest big city. New York City really stands alone, in terms of allowing tall buildings.  
请记住，这是美国第二密集的大城市。纽约市在允许高楼方面确实独树一帜。

New York City is also unique in having an extensive subway system. In terms of miles of rail, NYC has more than other cities, but just as important is the shape of the network. NYC’s subway is a dense grid that covers all of Manhattan and much of Brooklyn; other cities tend to have commuter rail systems that connect the city center directly to outlying areas but which aren’t as useful for getting around within the central city. For example, here are train maps for NYC, San Francisco, and Boston:  
纽约市在拥有广泛的地铁系统方面也独具特色。在铁路里程方面，纽约市的长度超过其他城市，但同样重要的是网络的形状。纽约市的地铁是一个密集的网格，覆盖了整个曼哈顿和大部分布鲁克林；其他城市往往有通勤铁路系统，直接将市中心与边缘地区连接，但在市中心内部的出行上并不那么方便。例如，这里是纽约市、旧金山和波士顿的火车地图：

American cities are no longer able to build subways. This is partly because we’ve outlawed the cheap methods used to build them:  
美国城市不再能够建设地铁。这部分是因为我们已经禁止了用于廉价建造地铁的方法：

But a lot of it is because of the same problems of low state capacity and excessive citizen [input](https://substack.com/redirect/14805d33-42a1-4fe0-a9a4-354a8b418393?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that block every other construction project in America.  
但很多原因也与低国家能力和过度的市民[参与](https://substack.com/redirect/14805d33-42a1-4fe0-a9a4-354a8b418393?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)有关，这些问题阻碍了美国的其他建设项目。

In other words, America has only one New York because no other American city wants to become like New York. Throughout the country, “Manhattanization” is a scary term that gets thrown at any developer who wants to increase density.  
换句话说，美国只有一个纽约，因为没有其他美国城市想要变得像纽约。全国范围内，“曼哈顿化”是一个可怕的术语，用来指责任何想要增加密度的开发商。

And yet the number of Americans who want to live in NYC is not small; it’s huge. NYC 1-bedroom rents have been soaring, even as they stagnate nationwide:  
然而，想要住在纽约市的美国人并不少；这个数字非常庞大。纽约市一居室的租金飙升，即使全国范围内的租金停滞不前：

Someone wants to live in NYC, obviously. Partly that’s because of the enormous consumption benefits for the young wealthy childless [people](https://substack.com/redirect/beda94eb-1f39-42d0-9853-58d062cfd50a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) who love living in cities. And partly that’s because dense cities allow industrial clustering [effects](https://substack.com/redirect/c9d5dae9-db24-4431-a381-0a649e08057d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) — everyone knows that if you want to hire good employees in banking, publishing, corporate law, and so on, it helps to be in NYC.  
显然，有人想住在纽约市。这部分是因为对于那些热爱城市生活的年轻富裕无子女的[人群](https://substack.com/redirect/beda94eb-1f39-42d0-9853-58d062cfd50a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)来说，消费的好处是巨大的。而部分原因是密集的城市允许工业聚集[效应](https://substack.com/redirect/c9d5dae9-db24-4431-a381-0a649e08057d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)——每个人都知道，如果你想在银行、出版、公司法律等领域雇佣优秀员工，身处纽约市是有帮助的。

Is one city enough to hold all of the Americans who want to live in big, dense cities, as well as all of the Americans who need to live there for work? It is not. The middle class is being pushed out of [NYC](https://substack.com/redirect/c762464f-7544-4421-b9f7-2bc6c572c900?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) at a rapid clip. Americans are trying to pile into other cities, but NIMBYism isn’t letting those cities build many new houses to accommodate them; as a result, rents in other cities go up faster than [wages](https://substack.com/redirect/c9aaa174-b26f-4ece-a1fe-0edbe9ab19d7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).  
一个城市是否足够容纳所有想住在大城市和密集城市的美国人，以及所有因工作需要住在那里的人？答案是否定的。中产阶级正在迅速被挤出[纽约市](https://substack.com/redirect/c762464f-7544-4421-b9f7-2bc6c572c900?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。美国人试图涌入其他城市，但NIMBY主义不允许这些城市建造许多新房来容纳他们；结果，其他城市的租金上涨速度超过了[工资](https://substack.com/redirect/c9aaa174-b26f-4ece-a1fe-0edbe9ab19d7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。

America needs more than one NYC. It needs Chicago, Philadelphia, and other big old cities with existing walkable urban cores to step up and Manhattanize themselves, so that the country won’t just have one Manhattan.  
美国需要的不止一个纽约市。它需要芝加哥、费城和其他拥有现有步行城市核心的大城市，来提升自己并实现曼哈顿化，这样这个国家就不会只有一个曼哈顿。

How can this be done? The first step is simply to adopt NYC-style big floor-area ratios, as well as all the city’s other permissive building policies. Allow more density, and some density will get built.  
这该如何实现呢？第一步就是简单地采用纽约市风格的大建筑面积比率，以及该市的其他宽松建筑政策。允许更高的密度，某些密度就会被建造出来。

The second thing these cities can do is to build more trains. Because the “cut and cover” policies that build subways cheaply are always very unpopular, this probably also means building elevated trains and surface rail. NIMBYism will have to be overcome, but that’s true of just about anything that anyone wants to get done. Cities should also focus on building trains that allow their residents to get around the city, rather than just get into and out of the city; this means constructing trains in a grid or web pattern.  
这些城市可以做的第二件事是建造更多的火车。因为“切割和覆盖”政策使得地铁廉价建造总是不受欢迎，这可能也意味着要建造高架火车和地面铁路。NIMBY主义必须被克服，但这适用于任何人想要完成的事情。城市还应该专注于建造能够让
