Donald Trump has been able to convert Immigration and Customs Enforcement (and Customs and Border Protection, which is effectively part of the same operation) into a huge secret police force — because what are we supposed to call an organization whose masked agents, bearing no identification, simply grab people off the street? Who shoot at a [family](https://substack.com/redirect/803c4c6d-6852-40cc-8f7e-e7c73d51660d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) fleeing in their truck, after agents refused to identify themselves and smashed the car window, claiming – apparently falsely according to video footage – that the driver tried to harm them?
We’ve also seen both deportations to foreign gulags and the creation of a network of domestic detention centers — call it the ICE archipelago — that are overcrowded, filthy, and breeding grounds for disease. Last week a judge [ordered](https://substack.com/redirect/4d839f2e-fc47-4f0d-8e08-99f367b04fc3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that detainees at ICE’s Manhattan facility be given bedding mats rather than being forced to sleep on dirty concrete floors, have access to decent hygiene, and receive three meals a day. We’ll see whether this order is obeyed, but it gives you an idea of the conditions detainees are currently facing.
And the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill gives [ICE](https://substack.com/redirect/29e054f7-bcb3-4c2d-9dda-a70360b7949b?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) $45 billion to expand its network of detention centers, making room for around 100,000 more detainees, plus $30 billion for arrest and deportation efforts, enough to hire around 10,000 more ICE agents.
I worry, as everyone should, about how a huge expansion of this deeply un-American organization may be used as a tool of presidential power and repression. Furthermore, give people power without accountability — and it’s hard to give a better example than masked, unidentified agents authorized to use force — and some of them will abuse their position. And given what ICE has already been doing, what kind of people do you think are likely to sign up as it massively expands?
Compared with these issues, concerns about the economic impact of mass deportations are definitely second-tier. But they’re still important, and a subject I know something about. So the rest of this post will be devoted to how the Trump administration is about to ICE the economy.
First things first: Trump officials and some of their allies have been touting numbers that appear to show 2 million native-born Americans gaining jobs over the past year. But this claim is, as Jed Kolko of the Peterson Institute says, a “multiple-count data [felony](https://substack.com/redirect/2f622dfc-2c64-40c7-a711-986474fa7e70?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).” Read Kolko for the details showing that this is a statistical artifact, not something that really happened. No, the native-born adult population didn’t suddenly jump by 4 million in a single year.
What will actually happen is a large decline in America’s foreign-born labor force. When Stephen Miller began promising to deport 3,000 immigrants a day, many people dismissed this as an idle boast. It’s true that we can’t possibly deport people anywhere near that rapidly while obeying the law and following due process. And your point is?
Incredibly, I quite often hear people saying that illegal immigrants aren’t entitled to due process. Are such people really unable to understand that the point of due process is to determine whether someone is, in fact, here legally?
In any case, ICE arrests have been [skyrocketing](https://substack.com/redirect/2f622dfc-2c64-40c7-a711-986474fa7e70?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) — not yet to Miller’s target, but heading there:
We don’t know how many workers will eventually be incarcerated and deported. But undocumented immigrants make up around 5 percent of the U.S. work [force](https://substack.com/redirect/0c210150-ac0a-41bf-8e7a-dc87a8bed410?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). It seems plausible that a significant fraction of those workers will be pushed out, along with a number of legal workers snatched up based, as Trump’s border czar has said, on their physical [appearance](https://substack.com/redirect/3cb10528-4a9a-4c7a-813c-284afc768407?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).
Losing large numbers of workers sounds as if it will be bad for the U.S. economy. In fact, it will be worse than you may think.
The reason is that immigrant workers aren’t spread evenly across the economy. They’re strongly concentrated in certain industries and occupations, where they constitute a large share, sometimes a majority, of the work force. As a result, the Trump administration’s latter-day Edict of [Expulsion](https://substack.com/redirect/af4c96be-fae9-4425-9b37-4b4a69480eaa?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) will be far more disruptive to the economy than the aggregate number of workers deported might suggest.
Consider, for example, agriculture. There are about 1.6 [million](https://substack.com/redirect/02bc633d-0b0e-44be-bb76-2a7191729b8c?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) paid agricultural workers in America, the great majority immigrants. Many of those immigrants are here legally, but it’s all too easy to imagine that anyone with brown skin will be at risk. So imagine that 800,000 of those workers end up being incarcerated and/or deported.
That’s a lot of workers, but America is a big country, so it’s only about half a percent of total [employment](https://substack.com/redirect/5425826a-6638-43b5-ae5f-17d61ef7c926?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Not such a big deal, right? Except that the effect would be to cripple agricultural production, inflicting far more economic damage than a half-point across-the-board reduction in labor supply.
The loss of those workers would also be inflationary, sharply raising the prices of farm products.
You can tell similar stories for meatpacking, senior care, construction and more. Immigrants aren’t taking jobs away from native-born workers. For the most part they’re employed in jobs native-born Americans aren’t willing to do. As a result, ICEing the economy will make native-born Americans substantially worse off.
In fact, my guess is that arrests and deportations will eventually do even more economic harm than tariffs.

Donald Trump has been able to convert Immigration and Customs Enforcement (and Customs and Border Protection, which is effectively part of the same operation) into a huge secret police force — because what are we supposed to call an organization whose masked agents, bearing no identification, simply grab people off the street? Who shoot at a [family](https://substack.com/redirect/803c4c6d-6852-40cc-8f7e-e7c73d51660d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) fleeing in their truck, after agents refused to identify themselves and smashed the car window, claiming – apparently falsely according to video footage – that the driver tried to harm them?  
唐纳德·特朗普已经能够将移民和海关执法局（以及海关和边境保护局，实际上是同一操作的一部分）转变为一个巨大的秘密警察部队——因为我们应该如何称呼一个其蒙面特工没有任何身份标识、直接从街上抓人的组织呢？他们向一辆[家庭](https://substack.com/redirect/803c4c6d-6852-40cc-8f7e-e7c73d51660d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)逃跑的卡车开枪，在特工拒绝自我表明身份并砸碎车窗后，声称——显然根据视频资料是错误的——司机试图伤害他们？  

We’ve also seen both deportations to foreign gulags and the creation of a network of domestic detention centers — call it the ICE archipelago — that are overcrowded, filthy, and breeding grounds for disease. Last week a judge [ordered](https://substack.com/redirect/4d839f2e-fc47-4f0d-8e08-99f367b04fc3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that detainees at ICE’s Manhattan facility be given bedding mats rather than being forced to sleep on dirty concrete floors, have access to decent hygiene, and receive three meals a day. We’ll see whether this order is obeyed, but it gives you an idea of the conditions detainees are currently facing.  
我们还看到有移民被驱逐到外国的集中营，以及创建一个国内拘留中心网络——称之为ICE群岛——这些地方人满为患、肮脏不堪，是疾病的滋生地。上周，一位法官[命令](https://substack.com/redirect/4d839f2e-fc47-4f0d-8e08-99f367b04fc3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)ICE在曼哈顿的设施中应为被拘留者提供床垫，而不是强迫他们在肮脏的混凝土地板上睡觉，确保他们有良好的卫生条件，并每天提供三餐。我们将看看这个命令是否会被遵守，但这让你对被拘留者目前面临的条件有了一个了解。  

And the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill gives [ICE](https://substack.com/redirect/29e054f7-bcb3-4c2d-9dda-a70360b7949b?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) $45 billion to expand its network of detention centers, making room for around 100,000 more detainees, plus $30 billion for arrest and deportation efforts, enough to hire around 10,000 more ICE agents.  
最近通过的《美丽大法案》为[ICE](https://substack.com/redirect/29e054f7-bcb3-4c2d-9dda-a70360b7949b?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)提供了450亿美元，用于扩展其拘留中心网络，为大约10万名被拘留者腾出空间，以及300亿美元用于逮捕和驱逐的努力，足够雇佣大约1万名额外的ICE特工。  

I worry, as everyone should, about how a huge expansion of this deeply un-American organization may be used as a tool of presidential power and repression. Furthermore, give people power without accountability — and it’s hard to give a better example than masked, unidentified agents authorized to use force — and some of them will abuse their position. And given what ICE has already been doing, what kind of people do you think are likely to sign up as it massively expands?  
我担心，正如每个人都应该担心的那样，这个深具反美性质的组织的大规模扩张可能会被用作总统权力和压迫的工具。此外，赋予人们权力而没有问责制——很难找到比被授权使用武力的蒙面、未被识别的特工更好的例子——其中一些人将会滥用他们的职权。考虑到ICE已经在做的事情，你认为什么样的人可能会在它大规模扩张时加入？  

Compared with these issues, concerns about the economic impact of mass deportations are definitely second-tier. But they’re still important, and a subject I know something about. So the rest of this post will be devoted to how the Trump administration is about to ICE the economy.  
与这些问题相比，关于大规模驱逐的经济影响的担忧无疑是次要的。但它们仍然很重要，而且是我了解的一些主题。因此，本文的其余部分将专注于特朗普政府如何即将冰封经济。  

First things first: Trump officials and some of their allies have been touting numbers that appear to show 2 million native-born Americans gaining jobs over the past year. But this claim is, as Jed Kolko of the Peterson Institute says, a “multiple-count data [felony](https://substack.com/redirect/2f622dfc-2c64-40c7-a711-986474fa7e70?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).” Read Kolko for the details showing that this is a statistical artifact, not something that really happened. No, the native-born adult population didn’t suddenly jump by 4 million in a single year.  
首先，特朗普的官员和他们的一些盟友一直在宣传一些数字，似乎显示过去一年有200万美国本土出生的人获得了工作。但正如彼得森研究所的杰德·科尔科所说，这一说法是“多重计数数据[罪行](https://substack.com/redirect/2f622dfc-2c64-40c7-a711-986474fa7e70?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)”。阅读科尔科的详细信息，显示这是一个统计伪影，而不是实际发生的事情。不，本土出生的成年人口并没有在一年内突然增加400万。  

What will actually happen is a large decline in America’s foreign-born labor force. When Stephen Miller began promising to deport 3,000 immigrants a day, many people dismissed this as an idle boast. It’s true that we can’t possibly deport people anywhere near that rapidly while obeying the law and following due process. And your point is?  
实际上发生的将是美国外籍劳动力的大幅下降。当斯蒂芬·米勒开始承诺每天驱逐3000名移民时，许多人将其视为无聊的夸口。确实，我们不可能在遵守法律和遵循正当程序的情况下以如此迅速的速度驱逐人。你的意思是？  

Incredibly, I quite often hear people saying that illegal immigrants aren’t entitled to due process. Are such people really unable to understand that the point of due process is to determine whether someone is, in fact, here legally?  
令人难以置信的是，我常常听到人们说非法移民没有权利享受正当程序。这些人真的无法理解正当程序的目的在于确定某人是否确实在这里合法吗？  

In any case, ICE arrests have been [skyrocketing](https://substack.com/redirect/2f622dfc-2c64-40c7-a711-986474fa7e70?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) — not yet to Miller’s target, but heading there:  
无论如何，ICE的逮捕人数已经在[激增](https://substack.com/redirect/2f622dfc-2c64-40c7-a711-986474fa7e70?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)——虽然还没有达到米勒的目标，但正在朝着那个方向发展：  

We don’t know how many workers will eventually be incarcerated and deported. But undocumented immigrants make up around 5 percent of the U.S. work [force](https://substack.com/redirect/0c210150-ac0a-41bf-8e7a-dc87a8bed410?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). It seems plausible that a significant fraction of those workers will be pushed out, along with a number of legal workers snatched up based, as Trump’s border czar has said, on their physical [appearance](https://substack.com/redirect/3cb10528-4a9a-4c7a-813c-284afc768407?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).  
我们不知道最终会有多少工人被监禁和驱逐。但无证移民大约占美国劳动力的5%[](https://substack.com/redirect/0c210150-ac0a-41bf-8e7a-dc87a8bed410?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。似乎可以合理地认为，这些工人中会有相当一部分被驱逐，还有一些合法工人也会被抓住，正如特朗普的边境沙皇所说，基于他们的外貌[](https://substack.com/redirect/3cb10528-4a9a-4c7a-813c-284afc768407?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。  

Losing large numbers of workers sounds as if it will be bad for the U.S. economy. In fact, it will be worse than you may think.  
失去大量工人听起来对美国经济会很糟糕。实际上，情况会比你想象的更糟。  

The reason is that immigrant workers aren’t spread evenly across the economy. They’re strongly concentrated in certain industries and occupations, where they constitute a large share, sometimes a majority, of the work force. As a result, the Trump administration’s latter-day Edict of [Expulsion](https://substack.com/redirect/af4c96be-fae9-4425-9b37-4b4a69480eaa?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) will be far more disruptive to the economy than the aggregate number of workers deported might suggest.  
原因在于，移民工人并不是均匀分布在经济中的。他们在某些行业和职业中高度集中，在这些领域，他们占据了很大一部分，有时甚至是大多数劳动力。因此，特朗普政府的后期[驱逐令](https://substack.com/redirect/af4c96be-fae9-4425-9b37-4b4a69480eaa?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)将对经济造成的干扰远远超过被驱逐工人的总数可能暗示的情况。  

Consider, for example, agriculture. There are about 1.6 [million](https://substack.com/redirect/02bc633d-0b0e-44be-bb76-2a7191729b8c?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) paid agricultural workers in America, the great majority immigrants. Many of those immigrants are here legally, but it’s all too easy to imagine that anyone with brown skin will be at risk. So imagine that 800,000 of those workers end up being incarcerated and/or deported.  
例如，考虑农业。美国大约有160万[](https://substack.com/redirect/02bc633d-0b0e-44be-bb76-2a7191729b8c?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)名有偿农业工人，其中绝大多数是移民。许多移民是合法居留的，但很容易想象，任何肤色较深的人都会面临风险。那么想象一下，80万名工人最终被监禁和/或驱逐。  

That’s a lot of workers, but America is a big country, so it’s only about half a percent of total [employment](https://substack.com/redirect/5425826a-6638-43b5-ae5f-17d61ef7c926?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Not such a big deal, right? Except that the effect would be to cripple agricultural production, inflicting far more economic damage than a half-point across-the-board reduction in labor supply.  
这是一大批工人，但美国是个大国，所以这仅占总[就业](https://substack.com/redirect/5425826a-6638-43b5-ae5f-17d61ef7c926?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)的约0.5%。这没什么大不了的，对吧？除了这一影响将使农业生产瘫痪，造成的经济损失远远超过劳动力供应普遍减少0.5%的损失。  

The loss of those workers would also be inflationary, sharply raising the prices of farm products.  
失去这些工人也会导致通货膨胀，急剧推高农产品的价格。  

You can tell similar stories for meatpacking, senior care, construction and more. Immigrants aren’t taking jobs away from native-born workers. For the most part they’re employed in jobs native-born Americans aren’t willing to do. As a result, ICEing the economy will make native-born Americans substantially worse off.  
你可以为肉类加工、老年护理、建筑等领域讲述类似的故事。移民并没有抢走本土工人的工作。在大多数情况下，他们从事的是本土美国人不愿意做的工作。因此，冰封经济将使本土美国人变得更加糟糕。  

In fact, my guess is that arrests and deportations will eventually do even more economic harm than tariffs.  
事实上，我的猜测是，逮捕和驱逐最终将造成的经济损害甚至超过关税。
