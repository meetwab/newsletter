Today I saw my friend Noor [Siddiqui](https://substack.com/redirect/fdb3777a-5a9c-465d-abeb-1535e07afb34?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) getting some grief on the internet. Noor is the founder and CEO of [Orchid](https://substack.com/redirect/101db36a-0e7e-406a-bcad-1fc103cae49a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), a company that will select your embryos for IVF in order to avoid passing on genetic diseases. As someone with a number of friends who have genetic disorders, this seems highly appealing — I think most parents would want their child not to have to suffer the same innate handicaps that they suffered. Noor was recently interviewed about her [company](https://substack.com/redirect/f1805af0-e957-4d54-b12e-8ca17e1b8e2a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) by Ross Douthat of the New York Times. 
When she tweeted out a link to the interview, Noor [asked](https://substack.com/redirect/e3f1da46-88fd-4908-af25-0c07b9710f8b?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA):
What if your baby never walks? What if they are never able to live independently? What if you could have stopped it… but chose not to? That’s the question @[OrchidInc](https://substack.com/redirect/0659f4b5-123d-4318-9ba4-b20a9acdb341?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)’s embryo screening forces. You optimize everything…career, diet, skincare…but you’re going to chance it on your child’s genome, one of the most significant determinants of their health?
A lot of people on X got mad at [this](https://substack.com/redirect/15aefdd3-81a6-4e9a-9a85-3adb96a4fda9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), calling it “eugenics”, claiming that it invalidated the life of people born with genetic disorders, and generally saying that Noor’s vision of healthy babies is dystopian.
The argument reminded me of one of my favorite essays that I’ve ever written — my New Year’s [post](https://substack.com/redirect/04eb2ffb-e31c-44b0-9b9d-d8b6550a6788?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) in January 2024. It was about how lots of people have the instinct to value human suffering, and to disdain technological solutions that make the struggles of the past obsolete. I thought I’d repost it, because I think it applies to the controversy over embryo screening as well.
“I would love to live to be 50 years old.” — Keith Haring
Yes, this post starts with the latest ridiculous contretemps on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. But I promise, it gets more interesting!
The latest contretemps revolves around a famous painting: Keith Haring’s Unfinished [Painting](https://substack.com/redirect/aff09a61-0192-4bf7-9d92-0a2b3ce62156?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Painted in 1989, it represented the artist’s impending death from AIDS. Haring died the following year, at the age of 31.
It’s an incredibly haunting, tragic image. The streaks of paint falling from the fragment of a pattern immediately evoke tears, blood, disintegration, futility; they emphasize just how much of the canvas was left blank. It’s a reminder of how much of our potential as individuals is wasted, and of an almost-forgotten pandemic that claimed 700,000 lives in the U.S. alone.
The other day, a pseudonymous account named DonnelVillager [posted](https://substack.com/redirect/0018b802-ff41-4eea-948a-64adb6363ba6?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) an AI-generated image that “completes” the pattern in the upper left of Haring’s painting:
DonnelVillager’s post — perfectly calculated to simulate ingenuousness, while actually poking fun at art appreciators — was itself a masterwork of internet pranksterism. It was instantly condemned by tens of thousands of angry Twitter users for “desecrating” Haring’s [art](https://substack.com/redirect/06b112e2-5033-47db-9f78-d4708d6b3ec9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Defenders [responded](https://substack.com/redirect/73e7a3bb-108e-4ff0-a1c2-fc138becdbbb?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that DonnelVillager’s trollish tweet was itself a work of art, and that the furious response proved that AI art has the potential to be transgressive and to tweak the cultural orthodoxy’s tail.
Normally I would just shake my head at one more social media food fight and move on. But this reply by my friend Daniel caught my eye:
Of course, Daniel is also poking fun, but in a very important way, he’s right. If AIDS had never existed — or if HIV treatments had come just a little sooner — Haring might have created something like DonnelVillager’s AI image. After all, a fair amount of Haring’s other work [did](https://substack.com/redirect/fad83a5d-c424-40a4-b584-52352b32bcdf?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) look like [that](https://substack.com/redirect/fad83a5d-c424-40a4-b584-52352b32bcdf?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).
And yes, without AIDS, Haring very well might never produced anything as haunting or evocative as Unfinished Painting. His art might have remained forever cheerful and whimsical, peppered with the occasional political statement. This June, William Poundstone [wrote](https://substack.com/redirect/aff09a61-0192-4bf7-9d92-0a2b3ce62156?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that “Everybody loves Keith Haring, but nobody takes him seriously…The [latest] exhibition does not exactly demolish the notion that Haring was repetitious.” The AI image that DonnelVillager created is an incredibly shallow thing — an unthinking regurgitation of meaningless patterns in a Haring-like style by a large statistical model. But without the pressure of a life cut short, Haring’s art might never have been as deep as it was.
Yet that would have been a good trade. Unfinished Painting is a great work of art, but it wasn’t worth the price of Haring’s life. Without AIDS, the world might have been a bit shallower, with less tragedy for humans to struggle against. But no one in their right mind wishes for tragedies to continue just so that human life can continue to be filled with pathos. Adversity is not worth the price of adversity. Even a world where Keith Haring lived to old age, but every one of his paintings was pointless AI-generated crap, would have been preferable to the world we actually got.
This got me thinking about the meaning of progress.
One of my grandfathers was a bombardier in the European theater of World War 2. He came back uninjured, but the stress of so many near-death experiences, and so many dead friends, drove him to lifelong alcoholism. Once, in the 1990s, I heard a conservative pundit claim that young Americans had become soft and weak because they had never had to face adversity like the World War 2 generation did. I asked my grandfather what he thought of that. After uttering something unprintable, he said: “I did that [stuff] so you wouldn’t have to.”
In a letter to his wife in 1780, John Adams, one of America’s founders, expressed a sentiment that was very similar to what my grandfather felt — and with which many veterans undoubtedly agree. He wrote:
I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.
Embedded in these statements is the belief that the trials and challenges of the world are potentially impermanent; that rather than something to be endured again and again ad infinitum, they are something that can and should be conquered and put behind us forever. It’s the belief that with effort, we can create a durably better world.
That’s not a trivial assumption. Humans have always dreamed of creating a better world, but for most of our history, the world stubbornly refused to get better at anything faster than a snail’s pace. A human in China or Europe or the Middle East in the year 1400 didn’t live a significantly better life than one in 400 B.C. Civilizations would rise, but then they would fall, smashed back to earth by something that looked suspiciously like a Malthusian [ceiling](https://substack.com/redirect/ef029725-b96f-445a-9993-75bc85265bf5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). As a Frenchman in the year 1000 you could dream of creating God’s kingdom on Earth, but short of supernatural intervention, you could not reasonably dream of a world without smallpox, bedbugs, or senile erectile dysfunction.
Then, of course, something changed. By now you’ve all seen the [graph](https://substack.com/redirect/d3bb3845-2260-44fa-bc57-79e5c28a6941?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) where world GDP creeps along and then explodes upward like a hockey stick; I won’t post it again. Instead I’ll post this one:
For American women to die from pregnancy used to be a normal occurrence; then in the 1930s and 1940s it became an extreme rarity. Suddenly, a fundamental fact of human suffering that had stubbornly resisted change since time immemorial simply gave way. We fought and lost, and fought and lost, and then one day we fought and won.
The proximate reason for the abrupt decline in maternal mortality was the invention of antibiotics in 1928, and the development of medical practices like blood transfusions whose safety depends on antibiotics. But although penicillin was discovered by [accident](https://substack.com/redirect/08534daa-9f0f-442a-9a9d-6bffca2247c8?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), it didn’t simply appear out of nowhere; its discovery required the edifice of an industrial society that took centuries to build. The victory over maternal mortality was achieved by a long struggle, not by a happy accident. (In fact, in some countries, maternal mortality began to fall in the [1800s](https://substack.com/redirect/e2609b87-b9eb-42bb-80f7-0bcfbe9e156e?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), thanks to the wealth created by industrialization.)
A romantic could argue, if they were so inclined, that the conquest of maternal mortality has made the world a shallower place. In the early 1800s, you could tell stories whose emotional power rested — explicitly or silently — on the universal knowledge that childbirth meant mortal danger. Today, our high school English teachers have to explain this to us when we read Jane Austen or Emily Brontë, just so we understand, on an intellectual level, how brave the women in their novels were.
Such conquests have become commonplace. HIV was a death sentence in 1995; the next year, David Ho and his team [unveiled](https://substack.com/redirect/6771c807-f575-43b1-b118-9e28530335ee?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) a new combination drug therapy that turned it into a manageable chronic [disease](https://substack.com/redirect/b86cac83-d9d9-4c7e-9504-5969161e37ec?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). And now, almost three decades later, Unfinished Painting is already becoming something that most people need explained to them; we still understand the meaning of terminal disease, but the context of AIDS, and especially what it meant to gay people in the political climate of the 1980s, is already fading from living memory into dry history.
As the world becomes safer — as one after another edifice of human suffering crumbles before the collective might of science, technology, and industrial society — it becomes harder to harness the emotional power of tragedy, risk, adversity, and heroism. The lives of more individuals become childlike, pure, and unmarked — or at least a little bit more so than before.
I first realized this years ago, while watching Disney’s The Little Mermaid. In the original 1837 Danish fairy [tale](https://substack.com/redirect/ca3645ce-ddbe-407a-a838-2aafc04a5144?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), the mermaid wagers her life on a chance to win the love of a prince; she fails, and her life is forfeit to the evil sea witch. In the 1989 Disney movie, the same exact thing happens — except instead of passively accepting defeat, the mermaid and the prince simply stab the sea witch in the [chest](https://substack.com/redirect/85903b2f-321a-450c-831a-31284becdd95?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) with the broken prow of a ship, and live happily ever after.
Perhaps this is the kind of resolution that could only feel natural and satisfying in America, a country that grew up after the Industrial Revolution. Some call Hollywood endings shallow, but they reflect our everyday reality in the modern world; what is David Ho’s defeat of AIDS, but the stabbing of an evil sea witch in the chest?
Nor, I think, are we simply on a temporary upswing. Some romanticists imagine that society is a cycle, where hard times create strong [men](https://substack.com/redirect/a8f055fd-ac30-4ca4-a51a-f40bab33e32c?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), who create good times, which creates weak men, who create hard times. But whether or not that sort of institutional cycle exists, the technologies discovered during the last upswing will be preserved. Countries may collapse, but humanity will not forget antibiotics.
Nor is there any sign that this process will be naturally limited by humans’ inability to appreciate the improvements in their material lives. There is no upper limit on the correlation between life satisfaction and [GDP](https://substack.com/redirect/72f2dc16-f539-47f7-9ba8-52a2258433b5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Contrary to popular myth, suicide rates tend strongly to [fall](https://substack.com/redirect/0dc5dcfc-81f4-4ef9-8c1e-17c5a467994f?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) as countries become richer. The higher measured rate of depression in developed nations is likely due not to ennui, but to better diagnosis.
Some romanticists feel the urge to knock over the edifice of industrial society intentionally, in order to kick against the seeming shallowness of modern life — to return humanity to a world of toil and struggle, in order to ennoble us. But these dark romantics are rightfully recognized in fiction and public discourse as villains. The heroes of our stories are the people like David Ho — the ones who fought to hoist humanity up from the muck so that future generations could be a little more childlike, the ones who studied politics and war so that our grandchildren may study statuary, tapestry, and porcelain.
Romanticists need to accept that the nobility of suffering has always been a coping mechanism — a way to sustain hope through the long twilight of apparent futility. And they need to accept that heroism is always inherently self-destroying — that saving the world requires that the world is worth having been saved.
And they must at least try to understand that in a more general sense, happiness isn’t truly shallow — it just has a different kind of depth. The [passions](https://substack.com/redirect/d0384b12-0800-4aa3-af89-41323f8c10c9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) of people raised in a kinder, gentler world may be alien and incomprehensible to the older generation, but they are no less intense, and the culture around them is no less complex. Adversity forces us to rise to its challenge, but abundance allows us to discover who we might become, and that is a different sort of adventure.
Looking back on my own life so far, I remember the happy child I was, before clinical depression changed [me](https://substack.com/redirect/c9077bf3-7799-4db6-a0e4-93122df2e4f9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Depression is horrible, but it added a richness and depth to the person I am today, and I appreciate the value of those changes. But if that happy child had gotten a chance to grow up without depression, I think he would have been changed in different ways, and under the tutelage of gentler teachers, would have become no less worthwhile and interesting of a person.
So it must be with humanity. The modern world of push-button marvels has lost something, but it has gained more than it has lost. By celebrating it, we honor the countless millennia of heroes who worked in some small way to bring it about, even as we dedicate ourselves to continuing their great enterprise. Our legacy is to fill the Universe with children who laugh more than we were allowed to.

今天我看到我的朋友诺尔 [西迪基](https://substack.com/redirect/fdb3777a-5a9c-465d-abeb-1535e07afb34?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) 在网上受到了一些指责。诺尔是 [Orchid](https://substack.com/redirect/101db36a-0e7e-406a-bcad-1fc103cae49a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) 的创始人兼首席执行官，这是一家为体外受精选择胚胎的公司，以避免遗传疾病的传递。作为有很多朋友患有遗传疾病的人，这个想法非常吸引人——我认为大多数父母都希望他们的孩子不必承受他们曾经遭受的先天性缺陷。诺尔最近接受了《纽约时报》的罗斯·道萨特关于她的 [公司的](https://substack.com/redirect/f1805af0-e957-4d54-b12e-8ca17e1b8e2a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)采访。

When she tweeted out a link to the interview, Noor [asked](https://substack.com/redirect/e3f1da46-88fd-4908-af25-0c07b9710f8b?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA):

许多人在 X 上对 [此事](https://substack.com/redirect/15aefdd3-81a6-4e9a-9a85-3adb96a4fda9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) 愤怒不已，称其为“优生学”，声称这无效化了那些出生时就有遗传疾病的人的生命，并普遍表示诺尔对健康婴儿的愿景是反乌托邦的。

The argument reminded me of one of my favorite essays that I’ve ever written — my New Year’s [post](https://substack.com/redirect/04eb2ffb-e31c-44b0-9b9d-d8b6550a6788?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) in January 2024.

“I would love to live to be 50 years old.” — Keith Haring  
“我希望活到50岁。”——基思·哈林

Yes, this post starts with the latest ridiculous contretemps on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. But I promise, it gets more interesting!  
是的，这篇文章以社交媒体平台上最新的荒谬争论开始，这个平台曾被称为推特。但我保证，接下来会更有趣！

The latest contretemps revolves around a famous painting: Keith Haring’s Unfinished [Painting](https://substack.com/redirect/aff09a61-0192-4bf7-9d92-0a2b3ce62156?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Painted in 1989, it represented the artist’s impending death from AIDS. Haring died the following year, at the age of 31.  
最新的争论围绕着一幅著名的画作：基思·哈林的未完成的 [画作](https://substack.com/redirect/aff09a61-0192-4bf7-9d92-0a2b3ce62156?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。这幅画创作于1989年，代表了艺术家即将因艾滋病去世的状态。哈林在翌年去世，享年31岁。

It’s an incredibly haunting, tragic image. The streaks of paint falling from the fragment of a pattern immediately evoke tears, blood, disintegration, futility; they emphasize just how much of the canvas was left blank. It’s a reminder of how much of our potential as individuals is wasted, and of an almost-forgotten pandemic that claimed 700,000 lives in the U.S. alone.  
这是一幅令人难以忘怀、悲惨的图像。画面上从图案碎片中流下的油漆条纹立刻唤起了眼泪、鲜血、解体和无力感；它们强调了画布上留白的部分有多少。这提醒我们，作为个体，我们的潜力有多少被浪费，以及一个几乎被遗忘的疫情在美国 alone 夺去了70万人的生命。

The other day, a pseudonymous account named DonnelVillager [posted](https://substack.com/redirect/0018b802-ff41-4eea-948a-64adb6363ba6?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) an AI-generated image that “completes” the pattern in the upper left of Haring’s painting:  
前几天，一个名为 DonnelVillager 的匿名账户 [发布了](https://substack.com/redirect/0018b802-ff41-4eea-948a-64adb6363ba6?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) 一幅 AI 生成的图像， “完成”了哈林画作左上角的图案：

DonnelVillager’s post — perfectly calculated to simulate ingenuousness, while actually poking fun at art appreciators — was itself a masterwork of internet pranksterism. It was instantly condemned by tens of thousands of angry Twitter users for “desecrating” Haring’s [art](https://substack.com/redirect/06b112e2-5033-47db-9f78-d4708d6b3ec9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Defenders [responded](https://substack.com/redirect/73e7a3bb-108e-4ff0-a1c2-fc138becdbbb?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that DonnelVillager’s trollish tweet was itself a work of art, and that the furious response proved that AI art has the potential to be transgressive and to tweak the cultural orthodoxy’s tail.  
DonnelVillager 的帖子——完美地计算出模拟天真，同时实际上是在嘲讽艺术欣赏者——本身就是网络恶作剧的杰作。它立刻被成千上万愤怒的推特用户谴责为“亵渎”哈林的 [艺术](https://substack.com/redirect/06b112e2-5033-47db-9f78-d4708d6b3ec9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。辩护者 [回应道](https://substack.com/redirect/73e7a3bb-108e-4ff0-a1c2-fc138becdbbb?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)，认为 DonnelVillager 的恶搞推文本身就是一件艺术作品，而愤怒的反应证明了 AI 艺术有潜力成为颠覆性的，并且可以调侃文化正统的尾巴。

Normally I would just shake my head at one more social media food fight and move on. But this reply by my friend Daniel caught my eye:  
通常我会对这种社交媒体上的争吵摇摇头，然后继续前行。但我朋友丹尼尔的这条回复引起了我的注意：

Of course, Daniel is also poking fun, but in a very important way, he’s right. If AIDS had never existed — or if HIV treatments had come just a little sooner — Haring might have created something like DonnelVillager’s AI image. After all, a fair amount of Haring’s other work [did](https://substack.com/redirect/fad83a5d-c424-40a4-b584-52352b32bcdf?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) look like [that](https://substack.com/redirect/fad83a5d-c424-40a4-b584-52352b32bcdf?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).  
当然，丹尼尔也在开玩笑，但在一个非常重要的方面，他是对的。如果艾滋病从未存在——或者如果 HIV 治疗稍微早一点到来——哈林可能会创作出类似 DonnelVillager 的 AI 图像。毕竟，哈林的其他作品 [确实](https://substack.com/redirect/fad83a5d-c424-40a4-b584-52352b32bcdf?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) 看起来像 [那样](https://substack.com/redirect/fad83a5d-c424-40a4-b584-52352b32bcdf?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。

And yes, without AIDS, Haring very well might never produced anything as haunting or evocative as Unfinished Painting. His art might have remained forever cheerful and whimsical, peppered with the occasional political statement. This June, William Poundstone [wrote](https://substack.com/redirect/aff09a61-0192-4bf7-9d92-0a2b3ce62156?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that “Everybody loves Keith Haring, but nobody takes him seriously…The [latest] exhibition does not exactly demolish the notion that Haring was repetitious.” The AI image that DonnelVillager created is an incredibly shallow thing — an unthinking regurgitation of meaningless patterns in a Haring-like style by a large statistical model. But without the pressure of a life cut short, Haring’s art might never have been as deep as it was.  
是的，如果没有艾滋病，哈林可能永远不会创作出
