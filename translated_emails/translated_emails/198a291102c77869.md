Donald Trump is choking off U.S. manufacturing with tariffs, replacing statistical agency personnel with apparatchiks who will manipulate data to make the President look good, and so on. Yet some progressives remain convinced that the key to winning back the country is to harness a wave of populist anger by attacking big corporations. I’m not sure I see the political logic there, but I guess I’m not much of an expert on politics.
Anyway, I’m sympathetic to the notion that monopoly power has [increased](https://substack.com/redirect/f3f452fb-3237-44fe-ac41-e8374011636f?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) in the U.S. economy since the turn of the century, and that this is making life harder for some Americans. But corporate power is simply not the cause of many of the problems regular Americans face — there are a lot of other things going on too. And because antitrust progressives insist on fitting every problem into the paradigm of corporate power, they end up believing a number of false things about the world. One example I’ve written about [before](https://substack.com/redirect/75c3ecc0-9a53-4457-8de4-43728f01f159?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) is that of health insurers, whom antitrust progressives view as the chief architect of everything that’s wrong with the U.S. health system; in fact, these companies make almost no profits and are fairly efficient.
Another important example is the housing market. Overall, housing has not actually gotten more expensive throughout America; if you compare median personal income to the CPI measure for rent of primary residence, you’ll see that income has actually gone up slightly faster than rent since 1980:
But in the attractive cities where most people would like to live if they had the choice, rent has gone up much faster than in the decayed Rust Belt cities and small towns where most Americans would prefer not to live. The rental crisis is a local one, but it’s real. 
Abundance liberals blame this problem on lack of housing supply, and support YIMBY policies to build more housing in cities. But although some progressives are coming around on this, many are strongly opposed to the abundance agenda. Instead, they want to blame high rents on powerful companies who buy up all the houses and then jack up prices. 
A few years ago, this manifested as a panic about BlackRock buying up large amounts of the housing stock in America. This was a silly mistake; BlackRock doesn’t buy [homes](https://substack.com/redirect/c700f937-60a2-4a43-8320-b0c780129c33?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), except indirectly by investing in stocks called REITs. People were probably thinking of Blackstone, a much smaller asset manager with a similar name, which does buy up [homes](https://substack.com/redirect/06c2c99a-f0f5-4145-8ae5-3e6ba5eaf2f0?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). 
In addition to this silly mistake, the broader panic just wasn’t based on facts. In 2021, Derek Thompson did a great job of debunking the [myth](https://substack.com/redirect/1d5a6aaa-e08f-4459-a5ee-4ad43fa59546?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA):
The U.S. has roughly 140 million housing units, a broad category that includes mansions, tiny townhouses, and apartments of all sizes. Of those 140 million units, about 80 million are stand-alone single-family homes. Of those 80 million, about 15 million are rental properties. Of those 15 million single-family rentals, institutional investors own about 300,000; most of the rest are owned by individual landlords. Of that 300,000, the real-estate rental company Invitation Homes—in which BlackRock is an investor—owns about 80,000. (To clear up a common confusion: The investment firm Blackstone, not BlackRock, established Invitation Homes. Don’t yell at me; I didn’t name them.)
Megacorps such as BlackRock, then, are not removing a large share of the market from individual ownership. Rental-home companies own less than half of one percent of all [housing](https://substack.com/redirect/eae6eaf6-f0a9-4f65-a66b-c199fe3b1629?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), even in states such as Texas, where they were actively buying up foreclosed properties after the Great Recession. Their recent buying has been small compared with the overall market.
The actual number of homes Blackstone (or BlackRock) was buying was tiny — far too tiny to affect rental prices in any significant way, except perhaps in a few very localized areas.
But somehow, despite its lack of connection to reality, the meme stuck around, and the size of the problem grew as the story was repeated around the internet. There are still people who [think](https://substack.com/redirect/038e7ceb-2592-4407-9bd8-c5f9978f77ce?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) BlackRock is buying up much of the housing in America. In fact, even some right-wingers are convinced of [this](https://substack.com/redirect/ac5afdc7-5997-480c-ab0d-f08ab4bf4426?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA):
The exact form of the claim varies. Sometimes it’s 44% of the housing that the evil corporations are buying up, sometimes it’s just 20%. Sometimes it’s BlackRock alone that’s responsible, sometimes it’s the private equity [industry](https://substack.com/redirect/11a49047-1730-4ed3-8020-350d702e1c2e?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA):
But the meme remains false. Many news outlets have debunked it over the years. For example, Logan Mohtashami posted the following [charts](https://substack.com/redirect/0a52ab3b-33b6-48b6-be75-531f2a05d9e2?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) in Yahoo Finance in 2024:
The first of the two charts shows that institutional buyers — which includes private equity, BlackRock, etc. — own only a tiny sliver of the homes in America. The second chart shows that there was a corporate home-buying spree in 2022, but it never even hit 5% of home purchases at its peak — far lower than the rumors claim. 
Kriston Capps also wrote a great [debunking](https://substack.com/redirect/5736a9a8-a9e4-477d-9932-a9d7dae1bb3e?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) of the “corporate landlords” myth in 2024. Here was his chart:
Almost zero of the U.S. housing stock gets bought by owners who own more than 9 units. Corporate landlords just aren’t significant enough to be driving the rental crisis in America’s most desirable cities. (Of course, this doesn’t stop anticorporate types from mocking the very [idea](https://substack.com/redirect/b128be01-fa42-424a-a9f7-144de5da6dc5?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that high rents are caused by something other than market power.)
In fact, it gets even worse for the antitrust story here. It turns out that corporate landlords probably don’t even do what antitrust people think they do! The common story is that corporations buy up all the houses in an area, thus creating a local monopoly, and using that local monopoly to jack up rents — which in turn causes gentrification and pushes poor people and minorities out of the neighborhood. 
Except Konhee Chang, an economics job market candidate, found [evidence](https://substack.com/redirect/5af8a163-2be9-4986-b6f1-af319523af03?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that corporate landlords actually make housing cheaper for lower-income folks, and lead to diversification instead of gentrification!
Using property-level data on tenants, home prices, rents, and acquisition timing, I show that increasing rental supply in American suburbs, where rentals are scarce and expensive relative to owner-occupied housing, reduces segregation by enabling lower-income, disproportionately non-White renters to move into neighborhoods where they otherwise could not afford to own. In response, nearby incumbent households are more likely to move out, perceiving renters as a disamenity. Large-scale landlords expand rental supply by converting owner-occupied homes into rentals, exploiting cost efficiencies from geographic concentration. 
Chang found that corporate landlords drive down rents and slightly raise the price of buying a house:
This is only to be expected, since what the corporate landlords are doing is buying up housing (which raises purchase prices because it increases demand) and converting it to rental units (which lowers rents because it increases supply). 
So as far as we can tell, corporate landlords — at least, right now — aren’t causing the harms that the antitrust progressives (and some right-wing pundits) claim. The cause of the housing crisis in desirable metro areas must lie elsewhere. The obvious [culprit](https://substack.com/redirect/44937e9b-21fa-4655-9e20-a0bfd3d6683c?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) here is just supply limitations — i.e., land-use regulations and NIMBYism. And the obvious way to address that is the abundance agenda. 
For antitrust progressives, the problem with that conclusion is that it doesn’t place the blame on their class enemies. If corporate power isn’t the problem when it comes to high rents, then it means fewer opportunities for progressives to harness populist rage against the business class. In addition, antitrust progressives probably still believe that they can harness a wave of anticorporate populist sentiment to buoy Democrats back to victory. I would be very surprised if that strategy worked. 
But in any case, the story that corporate landlords are making American housing unaffordable is simply false. It’s just another free-floating memetic myth that keeps getting in the way of our ability to solve our very real problems. And the zeal with which antitrust progressives have embraced and propagated that myth should make us a little more pessimistic about their ability to accomplish positive change in the current political economy.

Donald Trump is choking off U.S. manufacturing with tariffs, replacing statistical agency personnel with apparatchiks who will manipulate data to make the President look good, and so on. Yet some progressives remain convinced that the key to winning back the country is to harness a wave of populist anger by attacking big corporations.

唐纳德·特朗普通过关税扼杀美国制造业，用官僚替换统计机构的人员，以操纵数据让总统看起来更好，等等。然而，一些进步派仍然坚信，夺回国家的关键在于通过攻击大企业来利用一波民粹主义的愤怒。我不太明白其中的政治逻辑，但我想我并不是政治方面的专家。  

Anyway, I’m sympathetic to the notion that monopoly power has [increased](https://substack.com/redirect/f3f452fb-3237-44fe-ac41-e8374011636f?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) in the U.S. economy since the turn of the century, and that this is making life harder for some Americans. But corporate power is simply not the cause of many of the problems regular Americans face — there are a lot of other things going on too.

One example I’ve written about [before](https://substack.com/redirect/75c3ecc0-9a53-4457-8de4-43728f01f159?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) is that of health insurers, whom antitrust progressives view as the chief architect of everything that’s wrong with the U.S. health system; in fact, these companies make almost no profits and are fairly efficient.  
无论如何，我对垄断权力自世纪之交以来在美国经济中[增加](https://substack.com/redirect/f3f452fb-3237-44fe-ac41-e8374011636f?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)的观点表示同情，这使一些美国人的生活变得更加困难。但企业权力根本不是普通美国人面临的许多问题的原因——还有很多其他事情在发生。而且，由于反垄断进步派坚持将每个问题都纳入企业权力的范式，他们最终相信了一些关于世界的错误观点。我之前写过的一个例子是健康保险公司，反垄断进步派将其视为美国健康系统一切问题的主要设计者；实际上，这些公司几乎没有利润，且效率相当高。  

Another important example is the housing market. Overall, housing has not actually gotten more expensive throughout America; if you compare median personal income to the CPI measure for rent of primary residence, you’ll see that income has actually gone up slightly faster than rent since 1980:  
另一个重要的例子是住房市场。总体而言，美国的住房并没有变得更贵；如果你将中位个人收入与主要居住地租金的CPI指标进行比较，你会发现自1980年以来，收入实际上增长得略快于租金：  

But in the attractive cities where most people would like to live if they had the choice, rent has gone up much faster than in the decayed Rust Belt cities and small towns where most Americans would prefer not to live. The rental crisis is a local one, but it’s real.  
但在大多数人如果有选择的话会想要居住的吸引人的城市，租金的上涨速度远快于大多数美国人不愿意居住的衰败的“铁锈带”城市和小镇。租赁危机是一个地方性的问题，但它是真实存在的。  

Abundance liberals blame this problem on lack of housing supply, and support YIMBY policies to build more housing in cities. But although some progressives are coming around on this, many are strongly opposed to the abundance agenda. Instead, they want to blame high rents on powerful companies who buy up all the houses and then jack up prices.  
丰裕派自由主义者将这个问题归咎于住房供应不足，并支持YIMBY政策在城市中建造更多住房。但尽管一些进步派对此开始转变，许多人仍然强烈反对丰裕议程。相反，他们想将高租金归咎于那些买下所有房屋并抬高价格的强大公司。  

A few years ago, this manifested as a panic about BlackRock buying up large amounts of the housing stock in America. This was a silly mistake; BlackRock doesn’t buy [homes](https://substack.com/redirect/c700f937-60a2-4a43-8320-b0c780129c33?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), except indirectly by investing in stocks called REITs.

几年前，这表现为对黑石集团（BlackRock）在美国购买大量住房存量的恐慌。这是一个愚蠢的错误；黑石集团并不直接购买[房屋](https://substack.com/redirect/c700f937-60a2-4a43-8320-b0c780129c33?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)，而是通过投资名为REITs的股票间接购买。人们可能是在想黑石公司（Blackstone），这是一家规模小得多的资产管理公司，名字相似，确实会购买[房屋](https://substack.com/redirect/06c2c99a-f0f5-4145-8ae5-3e6ba5eaf2f0?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。

除了这个愚蠢的错误，广泛的恐慌也并不是基于事实。在2021年，德里克·汤普森（Derek Thompson）成功揭穿了这个[神话](https://substack.com/redirect/1d5a6aaa-e08f-4459-a5ee-4ad43fa59546?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)：  

The U.S. has roughly 140 million housing units, a broad category that includes mansions, tiny townhouses, and apartments of all sizes. Of those 140 million units, about 80 million are stand-alone single-family homes. Of those 80 million, about 15 million are rental properties. Of those 15 million single-family rentals, institutional investors own about 300,000; most of the rest are owned by individual landlords.

(To clear up a common confusion: The investment firm Blackstone, not BlackRock, established Invitation Homes. Don’t yell at me; I didn’t name them.)  
美国大约有1.4亿个住房单元，这是一个广泛的类别，包括豪宅、小型联排别墅和各种大小的公寓。在这1.4亿个单元中，大约8000万个是独立的单户住宅。在这8000万个中，大约1500万个是出租物业。在这1500万个单户出租房中，机构投资者拥有大约30万个；其余大部分由个人房东拥有。在这30万个中，房地产租赁公司Invitation Homes——黑石集团的投资者——拥有大约8万个。（为了解释一个常见的混淆：投资公司是黑石，而不是黑岩，成立了Invitation Homes。别对我大喊；我不是给他们起的名字。）  

Megacorps such as BlackRock, then, are not removing a large share of the market from individual ownership. Rental-home companies own less than half of one percent of all [housing](https://substack.com/redirect/eae6eaf6-f0a9-4f65-a66b-c199fe3b1629?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), even in states such as Texas, where they were actively buying up foreclosed properties after the Great Recession. Their recent buying has been small compared with the overall market.  
因此，像黑石这样的巨头并没有从个人所有权中移除市场的大部分份额。租赁公司拥有的所有[住房](https://substack.com/redirect/eae6eaf6-f0a9-4f65-a66b-c199fe3b1629?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)不到0.5%，即使在德克萨斯州等地，在大萧条后他们也积极购买被止赎的房产。他们最近的购买与整体市场相比很小。  

The actual number of homes Blackstone (or BlackRock) was buying was tiny — far too tiny to affect rental prices in any significant way, except perhaps in a few very localized areas.  
黑石（或黑岩）实际购买的房屋数量微乎其微——小到无法对租金价格产生任何显著影响，除了可能在一些非常局部的地区。  

But somehow, despite its lack of connection to reality, the meme stuck around, and the size of the problem grew as the story was repeated around the internet. There are still people who [think](https://substack.com/redirect/038e7ceb-2592-4407-9bd8-c5f9978f77ce?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) BlackRock is buying up much of the housing in America. In fact, even some right-wingers are convinced of [this](https://substack.com/redirect/ac5afdc7-5997-480c-ab0d-f08ab4bf4426?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA):  
但不知为何，尽管与现实没有联系，这个说法仍然存在，并且随着故事在互联网上的传播，问题的规模不断扩大。仍然有人[认为](https://substack.com/redirect/038e7ceb-2592-4407-9bd8-c5f9978f77ce?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)黑石正在购买美国的大部分住房。事实上，甚至一些右翼人士也相信[这一点](https://substack.com/redirect/ac5afdc7-5997-480c-ab0d-f08ab4bf4426?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)：  

The exact form of the claim varies. Sometimes it’s 44% of the housing that the evil corporations are buying up, sometimes it’s just 20%. Sometimes it’s BlackRock alone that’s responsible, sometimes it’s the private equity [industry](https://substack.com/redirect/11a49047-1730-4ed3-8020-350d702e1c2e?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA):  
这一说法的具体形式各不相同。有时说是邪恶的公司正在购买44%的住房，有时说只是20%。有时是黑石单独负责，有时是私募股权[行业](https://substack.com/redirect/11a49047-1730-4ed3-8020-350d702e1c2e?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)：  

But the meme remains false. Many news outlets have debunked it over the years. For example, Logan Mohtashami posted the following [charts](https://substack.com/redirect/0a52ab3b-33b6-48b6-be75-531f2a05d9e2?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) in Yahoo Finance in 2024:  
但这个说法仍然是错误的。许多新闻媒体多年来对此进行了揭穿。例如，洛根·莫塔沙米在2024年于雅虎财经发布了以下[图表](https://substack.com/redirect/0a52ab3b-33b6-48b6-be75-531f2a05d9e2?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)：  

The first of the two charts shows that institutional buyers — which includes private equity, BlackRock, etc. — own only a tiny sliver of the homes in America. The second chart shows that there was a corporate home-buying spree in 2022, but it never even hit 5% of home purchases at its peak — far lower than the rumors claim.  
这两张图表中的第一张显示，机构买家——包括私募股权、黑石等——在美国仅拥有一小部分房屋。第二张图表显示，2022年确实出现了一波企业购房热潮，但其峰值时的购房比例甚至未达到5%——远低于传言所称的比例。  

Kriston Capps also wrote a great [debunking](https://substack.com/redirect/5736a9a8-a9e4-477d-9932-a9d7dae1bb3e?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) of the “corporate landlords” myth in 2024. Here was his chart:  
克里斯顿·卡普斯（Kriston Capps）在2024年也写了一篇关于“企业房东”神话的精彩[揭穿](https://substack.com/redirect/5736a9a8-a9e4-477d-9932-a9d7dae1bb3e?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。以下是他的图表：  

Almost zero of the U.S. housing stock gets bought by owners who own more than 9 units. Corporate landlords just aren’t significant enough to be driving the rental crisis in America’s most desirable cities. (
