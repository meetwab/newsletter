Urban crime is a longstanding obsession for Donald Trump. Inaugural addresses are normally devoted to uplift and hope; his first inaugural was about “American carnage,” the wave of violent crime he claimed was destroying our cities. Last week he seized control of the DC police and sent in the National Guard to deal with what he claimed was out-of-control crime.  
城市犯罪一直是唐纳德·特朗普的一个长期痴迷。就职演说通常是关于提升和希望的；他的第一次就职演说则谈到了“美国的屠杀”，他声称这波暴力犯罪正在摧毁我们的城市。上周，他接管了华盛顿特区的警察，并派遣国民警卫队处理他所称的失控犯罪。  

But what do the data say? I’ve come to rely heavily on Jeff Asher, whose [Substack](https://substack.com/redirect/dcf480df-8214-4b15-bb32-dbcea9e9cb58?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) is an invaluable source of analysis and whose Real Time Crime [Index](https://substack.com/redirect/03eb904e-2d57-4dbc-ada2-3ca647f22148?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) lets us track recent developments in many cities. Jeff wrote presciently about [DC](https://substack.com/redirect/7b8a27e4-bfb8-4610-b5e2-8822389f8d10?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) just before Trump moved in.  
但数据说了什么呢？我开始非常依赖杰夫·阿舍，他的[Substack](https://substack.com/redirect/dcf480df-8214-4b15-bb32-dbcea9e9cb58?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)是一个宝贵的分析来源，他的实时犯罪[指数](https://substack.com/redirect/03eb904e-2d57-4dbc-ada2-3ca647f22148?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)让我们能够跟踪许多城市的最新动态。杰夫在特朗普入驻之前对[华盛顿特区](https://substack.com/redirect/7b8a27e4-bfb8-4610-b5e2-8822389f8d10?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)进行了深刻的分析。  

So this week I talked with Jeff about crime trends and his views on the recent apparent plunge. Transcript follows:  
所以这周我与杰夫谈论了犯罪趋势以及他对最近明显下降的看法。以下是对话记录：

Paul Krugman in Conversation with Jeff Asher  
保罗·克鲁格曼与杰夫·阿舍的对话  

(recorded 8/13/25)  
（录制于2025年8月13日）  

Paul Krugman: Well hi everybody. Paul Krugman again. This week I'm going to be talking with Jeff Asher, who is certainly my go-to guy, and I think a lot of people's go-to guy now on crime statistics. It's a subject that is important. Lots of statistics, lots of data to be interpreted. And Jeff's Substack, Jeff-[alytics](https://substack.com/redirect/dcf480df-8214-4b15-bb32-dbcea9e9cb58?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), is now where you can find a lot of the number crunching analytics interpretation. He also has some views on what's been driving swings in crime and this seems like a good week since we've just had something like martial law declared in the nation's capital—or something like that—on the grounds of crime.  
保罗·克鲁格曼：大家好，我是保罗·克鲁格曼。这周我将与杰夫·阿舍交谈，他无疑是我的首选专家，我认为现在很多人也把他视为犯罪统计方面的首选专家。这是一个重要的话题。有很多统计数据，需要进行大量解释。杰夫的Substack，Jeff-[alytics](https://substack.com/redirect/dcf480df-8214-4b15-bb32-dbcea9e9cb58?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)，是你可以找到许多数字分析解读的地方。他还对犯罪波动的驱动因素有一些看法，而这似乎是一个很好的时机，因为我们刚刚在国家首都宣布了类似于戒严的状态——或者说是因为犯罪的理由。  

So, hi Jeff.  
那么，嗨，杰夫。  

Jeff Asher: Hi. Yeah, it was a weird week to randomly write about DC. And then all of a sudden, everybody cared.  
杰夫·阿舍：嗨。是的，随机写关于华盛顿特区的内容是一个奇怪的星期。然后突然间，大家都关心了。  

Paul Krugman: Oh, that’s right. You had written about DC. You had read up about DC already. So, yeah, now everybody is caring about DC. I want to talk about all of these things. But first I just want to know, you are kind of unique in providing these perspectives. Tell me a little bit about your professional life story, how you got to this point.  
保罗·克鲁格曼：哦，没错。你之前写过关于华盛顿特区的内容。你已经对华盛顿特区进行了研究。所以，现在每个人都关心华盛顿特区。我想谈谈所有这些事情。但首先我想知道，你在提供这些观点方面是独一无二的。告诉我一点你的职业生涯故事，你是如何走到这一步的。  

Jeff Asher: So I'm in New Orleans. I was born and raised here and went to the University of Texas and then moved to DC for grad school and got my master's in DC and started working for the Defense Department. I did that for about a year, and then moved over to the CIA, where I was for five years and worked as just an analyst over there. They taught me to write and think and all that good stuff, and then I met my girlfriend who became my wife, and decided to move back home to be near my family.  
杰夫·阿舍：我在新奥尔良。我在这里出生和长大，去了德克萨斯大学，然后搬到华盛顿特区读研究生，在华盛顿特区获得了硕士学位，开始为国防部工作。我在那里工作了大约一年，然后转到中央情报局，在那里工作了五年，担任分析师。他们教会了我写作和思考等所有好东西，然后我遇到了我的女朋友，她后来成为了我的妻子，决定回家与家人住得近一些。  

You know, in DC, everybody can write and has a master's degree and can analyze and everything. And in New Orleans, it's a very anecdote driven city, but I was looking for employment. The place that I ended up looking was the police department, because they hadn't had a crime analyst in decades. And so I started working for NOPD. I was there about 18 months and decided I wanted to start consulting. And, one of the challenges of having worked first for the CIA and then for a police department is that you're sort of a nameless, faceless blob.  
你知道，在华盛顿特区，每个人都能写作，拥有硕士学位，能够进行分析等等。而在新奥尔良，这是一个非常依赖轶事的城市，但我在找工作。我最终寻找的地方是警察局，因为他们几十年来没有犯罪分析师了。所以我开始为新奥尔良警察局工作。我在那里工作了大约18个月，决定我想开始咨询。而且，首先在中央情报局工作，然后在警察局工作的一大挑战是，你有点像一个无名无脸的模糊存在。  

And if you want to be successful in business as an entrepreneur, you need to not be a nameless, faceless blob. And so the way that I sort of decided I would get myself out there was by writing. I got introduced to Nate Silver and started freelancing at 538 and then Upshot, and I've just sort of been writing for ten years, ten plus years on this subject, which feels under-reported from a pure data perspective. It's a very difficult subject to cover from a data perspective.  
如果你想在商业上作为企业家取得成功，你就需要不是一个无名无脸的模糊存在。因此，我决定通过写作来让自己出名。我认识了内特·西尔弗，开始在538和Upshot上自由撰稿，我在这个主题上已经写了十年，十年以上，从纯数据的角度来看，这个主题感觉被低估了。从数据的角度来看，这是一个非常难以报道的主题。  

Paul Krugman: And that was crime analysis for the CIA?  
保罗·克鲁格曼：那是为中央情报局进行的犯罪分析吗？  

Jeff Asher: No, that was just general analysis. The skill set is shockingly applicable to other subject matters. Once you can kind of learn to analyze stuff and to communicate it effectively, then you can do it elsewhere.  
杰夫·阿舍：不，那只是一般的分析。这个技能集在其他主题上也出奇地适用。一旦你学会了分析东西并有效地沟通，那么你就可以在其他地方做到这一点。  

Paul Krugman: Okay. That's a useful insight. But it also means that you're basically a deep state agent, so you can't be trusted on anything.  
保罗·克鲁格曼：好的。这是一个有用的见解。但这也意味着你基本上是一个深层政府的代理人，所以你在任何事情上都不能被信任。  

Jeff Asher: I've never denied that!  
杰夫·阿舍：我从未否认过这一点！  

Paul Krugman: Okay, so, before I started being able to draw on some of your stuff, I found it is hard to do the numbers on crime. So why don't you tell us a bit about what's involved in that?  
保罗·克鲁格曼：好的，在我开始能够引用你的一些内容之前，我发现对犯罪数据进行统计是很困难的。那么你为什么不告诉我们这其中涉及的内容呢？  

Why is it so hard? And why do we need AH [Datalytics](https://substack.com/redirect/240c090f-243a-41b2-b590-38888d954404?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), basically.  
为什么这么难？我们为什么需要AH [Datalytics](https://substack.com/redirect/240c090f-243a-41b2-b590-38888d954404?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)？  

Jeff Asher: The challenge is, we have expectations of precision with a lot of things. And I think we're kind of learning about this with the labor statistics as well, that our guesses are kind of guesses and they're decent guesses and we revise them. We can kind of accurately tell a story, but we don't have precision. And the comparison I like to make is living in DC in my 20s, I was right near the ballpark. I went to lots of Nationals games, so I became a big Nationals fan. And I loved in the last few years following James Wood, who's their big superstar coming up now. And I love going to Baseball Savants’ [website](https://substack.com/redirect/a126935f-c9e6-4c12-a53a-90828e22c839?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), where you can say, you know, “I want to see all the pitches in April 2024 that James Wood hit with an exit velocity off the bat of 100 plus miles per hour last night.” He hit a ball 118mph off the bat. So that's an insanely hard hit baseball. You can do that within seconds of the pitch being thrown and hit.  
杰夫·阿舍：挑战在于，我们对很多事情都有精确性的期望。我认为我们在劳动统计方面也在学习这一点，我们的猜测只是猜测，它们是合理的猜测，我们会对其进行修正。我们可以相对准确地讲述一个故事，但我们没有精确性。我喜欢做的比较是，在我20多岁的时候住在华盛顿特区，我就住在球场附近。我去过很多国民队的比赛，所以我成了一个狂热的国民队球迷。在过去的几年里，我喜欢关注詹姆斯·伍德，他是他们现在崭露头角的大明星。我喜欢访问Baseball Savants的[网站](https://substack.com/redirect/a126935f-c9e6-4c12-a53a-90828e22c839?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)，你可以说，“我想看看2024年4月詹姆斯·伍德击球时的出场速度超过100英里每小时的所有投球。”他击出了一球118英里每小时的球。所以这是一记极其强劲的击球。你可以在投球被投出并击中后的几秒钟内做到这一点。  

And you compare that to crime stats, where the FBI last week published the 2024 crime stats. They won't publish an estimate of 2025 until around this time next year. And this was really early. August is really early for them to publish crime data from the preceding year. By that point, your trends have changed. Your understanding of what's happening is kind of useless if you're going off of year old data.  
而你将其与犯罪统计数据进行比较，上周FBI发布了2024年的犯罪统计数据。他们不会在明年这个时候发布2025年的估计。而且这真的很早。八月对他们来说发布前一年犯罪数据真的很早。在那时，你的趋势已经改变。如果你依赖一年前的数据，你对正在发生的事情的理解就有点无用。  

And the other factor that I think lends itself now to analyzing data much more effectively, is that a lot of places are just publishing the data. A lot of cities, a lot of states, they're publishing the data daily, they're publishing it weekly, they're publishing it monthly. And the FBI is even going to start publishing their raw data monthly. It's going to be, for a lot of people, I think, a disaster to use just because it's going to be, “here's the raw data, unaudited, prone to being updated.” It's going to be difficult. But if you know how to use it, it can give really good insights. And so being able to evaluate monthly data, weekly data, daily data puts you in a position to understand, to know what the trends are basically as they occur, which for crime is kind of the first time we've ever been able to do that. And in a very nerdy way I think that’s very exciting.  
而我认为现在有助于更有效地分析数据的另一个因素是，很多地方正在发布数据。许多城市，许多州，他们每天、每周、每月发布数据。FBI甚至将开始每月发布他们的原始数据。我认为对很多人来说，这将是一个灾难，因为它将是“这是原始数据，未经审计，可能会更新。”这将很困难。但如果你知道如何使用它，它可以提供非常好的洞见。因此，能够评估每月数据、每周数据、每日数据使你能够理解，基本上在它们发生时了解趋势，这对犯罪来说是我们第一次能够做到这一点。我认为这在某种程度上是非常令人兴奋的。  

Paul Krugman: Okay, so crime data all ultimately comes from basically local police departments, right? It's not like how manual labor has BLS, that does its own surveys. They do interviews. But in this case we're relying on
