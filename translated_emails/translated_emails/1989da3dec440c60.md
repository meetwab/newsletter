[View this post on the web](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-48e)

I’ve got quite a few great podcasts for you today. One is this excellent live show that Erik Torenberg and I did with Dwarkesh Patel, in which we interview Dwarkesh about his thoughts on AI and the economy. The picture of me here is quite silly-looking, but the conversation was excellent:
I also went on Pascal-emmanuel Gobry’s podcast to debate him about illegal immigration:
And some Japanese media folks at a company called Glasp interviewed me about AI and jobs, and about foreign direct investment in Japan!
Finally, here’s an episode of Econ 102, where Erik and I discuss Javier Milei and various other topics:
Anyway, on to the roundup!
1. It doesn’t look like AI is taking jobs yet
It’s practically conventional wisdom that AI is going to take jobs away from large numbers of humans, leaving them without anything useful to do in the economy. People are so convinced of this that they’ll jump at practically any hint in the data that allows them to believe that it’s happening. A little while ago I wrote a post about why both economists and popular commentators are getting way over their skis on this:
Anyway, Sarah Eckhardt and Nathan Goldschlag of the Economic Innovation Group have a good new report on this, which shows that as far as we can tell, AI isn’t taking jobs yet — at least, not on any measurable scale.
Eckhardt and Goldschlag start with a [measure](https://substack.com/redirect/22121ff2-6a53-4107-8b63-ad818fa923aa?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) of predicted AI exposure for various jobs. These measures don’t tell you which jobs are going to be replaced by AI; instead, they just tell you which jobs currently involve more tasks that can probably be done by AI. These measures actually have a pretty good track [record](https://substack.com/redirect/e880a837-e33c-4539-9b41-544985fc8c22?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) at predicting which workers will end up using AI.
Basically, Eckhardt and Goldschlag find no correlation — or even a negative correlation — between that measure of AI exposure and any measure of labor market distress. For example, here’s the unemployment rate of workers with varying degrees of predicted AI exposure (1 is the least exposed, 5 is the most exposed):
There has been a recent rise in unemployment, but it’s concentrated among the people who are least exposed to AI, while those who are the most exposed almost all still have jobs. The same is true when we look only at recent college graduates, who have been the focus of the most concern in the media:
And the same is true when we look at which workers are exiting the labor force completely:
And one more interesting finding is that the most-exposed workers are actually less likely to switch to less-exposed occupations than they were before generative AI hit the market! In other words, coders and paper-pushers are not becoming plumbers to protect themselves from AI:
The researchers also try using alternative measures of AI exposure, and they find pretty much the same thing.
In other words, AI job displacement just hasn’t happened yet. It may happen in the future, but so far, every time people have jumped at a particular data point to claim it’s finally happening, it has turned out to be a mirage.
2. Bernie’s bad chart
Bernie Sanders and his followers deeply believe that America’s economy is in a prolonged state of crisis — that capitalist economic policies have steadily immiserated the American public, creating a country where regular people are economically drowning even as corporate fat cats enrich themselves. Their absolute faith in this narrative often leads them to interpret economic statistics in dubious or even ridiculous ways. The latest example of this is when Bernie Sanders posted a chart of housing versus wages:
This is a pretty ridiculous chart. Why would you plot home prices on the same y-axis as weekly income? Does anyone think these two things should be even remotely close to the same size? Do we think people should be able to afford a house on a single week of income? That’s ridiculous. 
A non-ridiculous way to present this data would be to divide home prices by weekly earnings. That would show us how many weeks a typical worker would need to work in order to afford a home. But actually, the “median weekly earnings” number is for full-time workers only, so instead we should use median personal income, which counts everybody. Here’s what that looks like:
In the 80s and 90s, it took about 8 years of work to afford a home. Since then, the number has climbed to about 10 years — a significant and concerning drop in affordability, but not a catastrophic drop. A breakdown by the Economic Innovation Group shows that mortgages are about as affordable as they ever were, but down payments have gotten less affordable:
While the drop in housing affordability over the past half century is certainly a problem, it’s not the kind of crisis that Bernie paints it as. Using silly charts in service of alarmist narratives ultimately just weakens trust in your movement — or at least, it should.
3. Personalist dictatorships are probably bad for the economy
The three most powerful countries in the world are now all ruled by strongmen. In China, Xi Jinping has subdued all rivals, and concentrated what used to be a dispersed bureaucratic oligarchy under his own personal [rule](https://substack.com/redirect/31cb2199-e820-4cfe-89d1-f055caa6e07a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). In Russia, Putin is effectively an emperor. The U.S. is still officially a democracy, but democratic norms and institutions are eroding rapidly, and in April a majority of Americans called Trump a “dictator” [ https://substack.com/redirect/802c3dcb-9570-4e6d-aec8-3bef0fbda59d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA ]. 
The question is what effect these personalistic regimes will have on the economy. China’s growth over the past four decades pretty much proves that democracy isn’t necessary for a strong or even dominant economy. But there’s a difference between countries ruled by a single strongman, and countries ruled by a system of elite institutions that distribute power among a number of oligarchs. 
A new paper by Blattman, Gehlbach, and [Yu](https://substack.com/redirect/5ad148ca-2752-4440-8608-dd245b8e8bfe?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) shows that personalist regimes tend to experience lower economic growth than either democracies or autocracies with more distributed power. The difference isn’t huge, but you can see it on a graph:
It’s not clear which direction the causation runs here; it could be that countries with bad economies tend to turn to strongmen to save them. But Blattman et al. test for this using variables that tend to predict regime transitions, and they don’t find any change. That implies that personalist regimes actually make mistakes that slow down economic growth. 
Xi, Putin, and Trump certainly don’t exactly seem to be violating that rule of thumb. China’s growth has slowed relentlessly under Xi, and his industrial policy seems to be simply driving Chinese companies into [unprofitability](https://substack.com/redirect/b87eb2e9-ff2d-4e4b-86a1-9b01d45cefcd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) rather than extricating the country from its economic [slump](https://substack.com/redirect/ac158bf5-6ecb-4f8d-8525-8c982be7264d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). Putin’s war in Ukraine is slowly crushing the [life](https://substack.com/redirect/9da512e8-6c29-4937-aab2-121d0c8048c8?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) out of the Russian economy, while Trump’s tariffs continue to wear [down](https://substack.com/redirect/1ad52afe-24ed-4127-86b8-5451beb093e7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) the resilient U.S. economy. 
The trend toward strongmen is a bad one.
4. Will AI save us from the social media trolls?
Does it ever seem like modern political discourse is dominated by crazy idiots? Well, that’s because it is. In a new [paper](https://substack.com/redirect/f8b33b4c-ee4c-43c5-ac6d-c75fa1fb8470?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) entitled “Dark personalities in the digital arena: how psychopathy and narcissism shape online political participation”, Ahmed and Masood find that your intuition isn’t wrong:
This cross-national study investigates how psychopathy, narcissism, and fear of missing out (FoMO) influence online political participation, and how cognitive ability moderates these associations. Drawing on data from the United States and seven Asian countries, the findings reveal that individuals high in psychopathy and FoMO are consistently more likely to engage in online political activity….Conversely, higher cognitive ability is uniformly associated with lower levels of online political participation. Notably, the relationship between psychopathy and participation is stronger among individuals with lower cognitive ability in five countries, suggesting that those with both high psychopathy and low cognitive ability are the most actively involved in online political engagement.
Almost everyone blames recent political trends on their chosen enemy group, but the real culprit is social media, which has elevated the worst people in our society to positions of influence from which they were previously shut out. 
What force can defeat the terrible power of social media and its armies of crazy idiots? In my Fourth of July [post](https://substack.com/redirect/19be2319-cb21-4037-9735-158c0e171617?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), I expressed hope that AI algorithms could be harnessed to defeat the hordes of humanity’s worst:
LLMs give platforms the ability to cheaply and quickly filter content according to sentiment. Simply having an LLM downrank angry content and uprank positive content would lean against the natural tendencies of social media technology. Call it Digital Walter Cronkite.
Of course, that solution would depend on the willingness of platform owners like Elon Musk to unleash algorithms in service of moderation and reasonability. That seems a bit like wishful thinking, I admit.
But there’s another possibility, which is that AI itself will simply naturally drive humans off of social media, by generating infinite amounts of slop. A new paper by Campante et al. [ https://substack.com/redirect/9f5ffe03-64b1-425e-b644-3db9c3b091e7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA ] finds evidence that AI-generated images nudge news consumers toward more trustworthy human-gatekept media:
We study how AI-generated misinformation affects demand for trustworthy news…Readers were randomly assigned to a treatment highlighting the challenge of distinguishing real from AI-generated images. The treatment raised concern with misinformation…and reduced trust in news…Importantly, it affected post-survey browsing behavior: daily visits to [the mainstream newspaper’s] digital content rose by 2.5%…[S]ubscriber retention increased by 1.1% after five months…Results are consistent with a model where the relative value of trustworthy news sources increases with the prevalence of misinformation, which may thus boost engagement with those sources even while lowering trust in news content.
A similar effect might happen with AI agents, which are already flooding social media with trash [commentary](https://substack.com/redirect/750493de-029e-4ce8-9fbf-57de3d0a3ff7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). As X and other social media companies lose the battle against the bot swarms, human users may stop relying on those feeds for their window on the world. The psychopaths and attention-seekers might simply get drowned out in the automated cacophony. 
That would be a weird end to the age of mass social media, but honestly it’s not the worst ending I could think of.
5. No, China isn’t just selling stuff to America through third countries
The American and Chinese economies continue to decouple. Even though Trump keeps “pausing” [ https://substack.com/redirect/68ab2487-b913-4da3-8cb5-ed2639b4ffff?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA ] his tariffs on China, China is selling less and less to America:
But you’ll notice that China’s exports to Europe and Southeast Asia are still growing strongly. This has led some commentators to [claim](https://substack.com/redirect/328754af-db63-4efc-b056-ce79a99ce96d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) that China is simply shipping its good through third-party countries, avoiding tariffs (or the threat of tariffs) by essentially just slapping a different “made in” label on stuff that was actually made in China.
Those claims are wrong. You can see that they’re wrong by looking at the actual products that China is selling to countries in Southeast Asia (the region usually accused of transshipping Chinese goods to the U.S.), versus the products it used to sell to the U.S. The two sets of products don’t match up very well, meaning that only a modest portion of Chinese trade with Southeast Asia could reflect diversion of trade from the U.S. Gerard DiPippo did this [exercise](https://substack.com/redirect/6304c318-cf83-44e0-bd32-42ad150677e6?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA):
Facing U.S. tariffs, China’s exports to the U.S. are down—while exports to Southeast Asia are up. Is that trade diversion and potential transshipment? My estimate: at most 34% of the increased PRC exports to SE Asia in Q2 could reflect trade diverted from the United States.
In fact, this is an upper bound. Many of the countries being accused of transshipping Chinese goods — Mexico, Vietnam, etc. — have their own industries as [well](https://substack.com/redirect/fae41613-d3ba-41f8-b5f5-d1b1fd543331?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), which export a lot to the U.S. Increased U.S. imports from those countries are likely to at least partially — or perhaps mostly — be locally made goods. 
All this goes to show that you can’t draw [conclusions](https://substack.com/redirect/8bf59036-5788-47ca-a8e2-31240e5d323c?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) about decoupling just from macro data. 
6. The rise of the power trad couples
There are a number of popular ideas out there about who marries whom. One is that rich men primarily want physically attractive wives and don’t care about social status, education, and so on. Another is that power couples tend to be dual earners. 
In fact, both of these stereotypes are wrong. As Lyman Stone shows in a post for the Institute for Family [Studies](https://substack.com/redirect/c11d736e-523d-4155-a9e6-67e70168abf8?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), rich men tend to marry highly educated, high-earning women women who become housewives after marriage. Here are some charts:
I don’t like the use of the word “overwhelmingly” in any of these charts, but the point is clear — rich men, who presumably have greater choice in who they marry, often tend to prefer women who are educated and high-income before marriage, but many of these women become homemakers after marriage. Call it the “power trad” couple.

I’ve got quite a few great podcasts for you today. One is this excellent live show that Erik Torenberg and I did with Dwarkesh Patel, in which we interview Dwarkesh about his thoughts on AI and the economy. The picture of me here is quite silly-looking, but the conversation was excellent:  
我今天有几个很棒的播客推荐给你们。其中一个是我和Erik Torenberg与Dwarkesh Patel一起做的精彩直播节目，我们采访了Dwarkesh，讨论了他对人工智能和经济的看法。这里的我看起来很傻，但谈话非常精彩：

I also went on Pascal-emmanuel Gobry’s podcast to debate him about illegal immigration:  
我还参加了Pascal-emmanuel Gobry的播客，与他辩论非法移民问题：

And some Japanese media folks at a company called Glasp interviewed me about AI and jobs, and about foreign direct investment in Japan!  
还有一些来自一家名为Glasp的日本媒体的朋友采访了我，讨论了人工智能与就业，以及外国直接投资在日本的情况！

Finally, here’s an episode of Econ 102, where Erik and I discuss Javier Milei and various other topics:  
最后，这是Econ 102的一集，Erik和我讨论了哈维尔·米莱和其他各种话题：

Anyway, on to the roundup!  
无论如何，接下来是总结！

1. It doesn’t look like AI is taking jobs yet  
1. 目前看起来人工智能并没有取代工作

It’s practically conventional wisdom that AI is going to take jobs away from large numbers of humans, leaving them without anything useful to do in the economy. People are so convinced of this that they’ll jump at practically any hint in the data that allows them to believe that it’s happening. A little while ago I wrote a post about why both economists and popular commentators are getting way over their skis on this:  
几乎可以说，大家都认为人工智能将会取代大量人类的工作，使他们在经济中无所事事。人们对此深信不疑，以至于他们会对数据中任何能够让他们相信这一点的线索感到兴奋。前一段时间，我写了一篇文章，讨论了为什么经济学家和流行评论员在这方面过于乐观：

Anyway, Sarah Eckhardt and Nathan Goldschlag of the Economic Innovation Group have a good new report on this, which shows that as far as we can tell, AI isn’t taking jobs yet — at least, not on any measurable scale.  
无论如何，经济创新小组的Sarah Eckhardt和Nathan Goldschlag对此有一份很好的新报告，显示就我们所知，人工智能目前并没有取代工作——至少在任何可衡量的范围内没有。

Eckhardt and Goldschlag start with a [measure](https://substack.com/redirect/22121ff2-6a53-4107-8b63-ad818fa923aa?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) of predicted AI exposure for various jobs. These measures don’t tell you which jobs are going to be replaced by AI; instead, they just tell you which jobs currently involve more tasks that can probably be done by AI. These measures actually have a pretty good track [record](https://substack.com/redirect/e880a837-e33c-4539-9b41-544985fc8c22?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) at predicting which workers will end up using AI.  
Eckhardt和Goldschlag首先使用了一个[指标](https://substack.com/redirect/22121ff2-6a53-4107-8b63-ad818fa923aa?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)来预测各种工作的人工智能暴露程度。这些指标并不能告诉你哪些工作将被人工智能取代；相反，它们只是告诉你哪些工作目前涉及更多可能由人工智能完成的任务。这些指标实际上在预测哪些工人最终会使用人工智能方面有着相当不错的[记录](https://substack.com/redirect/e880a837-e33c-4539-9b41-544985fc8c22?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。

Basically, Eckhardt and Goldschlag find no correlation — or even a negative correlation — between that measure of AI exposure and any measure of labor market distress. For example, here’s the unemployment rate of workers with varying degrees of predicted AI exposure (1 is the least exposed, 5 is the most exposed):  
基本上，Eckhardt和Goldschlag发现，人工智能暴露程度的指标与任何劳动市场困境的指标之间没有相关性——甚至是负相关性。例如，以下是不同程度人工智能暴露的工人的失业率（1是最少暴露，5是最多暴露）：

There has been a recent rise in unemployment, but it’s concentrated among the people who are least exposed to AI, while those who are the most exposed almost all still have jobs. The same is true when we look only at recent college graduates, who have been the focus of the most concern in the media:  
最近失业率有所上升，但这主要集中在那些对人工智能暴露最少的人身上，而那些对人工智能暴露最多的人几乎都还在工作。当我们只看最近的大学毕业生时，情况也是如此，他们一直是媒体关注的焦点：

And the same is true when we look at which workers are exiting the labor force completely:  
当我们观察哪些工人完全退出劳动力市场时，情况也是如此：

And one more interesting finding is that the most-exposed workers are actually less likely to switch to less-exposed occupations than they were before generative AI hit the market! In other words, coders and paper-pushers are not becoming plumbers to protect themselves from AI:  
还有一个有趣的发现是，受人工智能影响最深的工人实际上比生成性人工智能进入市场之前更不可能转向影响较小的职业！换句话说，程序员和文员并没有转行去做水管工以保护自己免受人工智能的影响：

The researchers also try using alternative measures of AI exposure, and they find pretty much the same thing.  
研究人员还尝试使用其他人工智能暴露的指标，他们发现几乎得出了相同的结论。

In other words, AI job displacement just hasn’t happened yet. It may happen in the future, but so far, every time people have jumped at a particular data point to claim it’s finally happening, it has turned out to be a mirage.  
换句话说，人工智能造成的工作流失尚未发生。未来可能会发生，但到目前为止，每当人们对某个特定数据点感到兴奋，声称这终于发生时，结果都被证明是海市蜃楼。

2. Bernie’s bad chart  
2. 伯尼的糟糕图表

Bernie Sanders and his followers deeply believe that America’s economy is in a prolonged state of crisis — that capitalist economic policies have steadily immiserated the American public, creating a country where regular people are economically drowning even as corporate fat cats enrich themselves. Their absolute faith in this narrative often leads them to interpret economic statistics in dubious or even ridiculous ways. The latest example of this is when Bernie Sanders posted a chart of housing versus wages:  
伯尼·桑德斯及其追随者深信美国经济正处于长期危机之中——资本主义经济政策不断使美国公众陷入困境，创造了一个普通人在经济上窘迫的国家，而企业巨头则在不断致富。他们对这一叙述的绝对信仰常常导致他们以可疑甚至荒谬的方式解读经济统计数据。最新的例子是伯尼·桑德斯发布了一张住房与工资的图表：

This is a pretty ridiculous chart. Why would you plot home prices on the same y-axis as weekly income? Does anyone think these two things should be even remotely close to the same size? Do we think people should be able to afford a house on a single week of income? That’s ridiculous.  
这是一张相当荒谬的图表。为什么要将房价与周收入放在同一个y轴上？有谁认为这两者应该有任何相近的大小吗？我们认为人们应该能够用一周的收入买得起房子吗？这太荒谬了。

A non-ridiculous way to present this data would be to divide home prices by weekly earnings. That would show us how many weeks a typical worker would need to work in order to afford a home. But actually, the “median weekly earnings” number is for full-time workers only, so instead we should use median personal income, which counts everybody. Here’s what that looks like:  
一种不荒谬的呈现这些数据的方式是将房价除以周收入。这将告诉我们一个典型工人需要工作多少周才能买得起房子。但实际上，“中位周收入”这个数字仅适用于全职工人，因此我们应该使用中位个人收入，这包括所有人。以下是这样的结果：

In the 80s and 90s, it took about 8 years of work to afford a home. Since then, the number has climbed to about 10 years — a significant and concerning drop in affordability, but not a catastrophic drop. A breakdown by the Economic Innovation Group shows that mortgages are about as affordable as they ever were, but down payments have gotten less affordable:  
在80年代和90年代，买得起房子大约需要8年的工作时间。从那时起，这个数字上升到了大约10年——这是一个显著且令人担忧的可负担性下降，但并不是灾难性的下降。经济创新小组的分析显示，抵押贷款的可负担性与以往相当，但首付的可负担性下降了：

While the drop in housing affordability over the past half century is certainly a problem, it’s not the kind of crisis that Bernie paints it as. Using silly charts in service of alarmist narratives ultimately just weakens trust in your movement — or at least, it should.  
虽然过去半个世纪住房可负担性的下降确实是个问题，但这并不是伯尼所描绘的那种危机。使用荒谬的图表来服务于危言耸听的叙述，最终只会削弱人们对你们运动的信任——或者至少应该如此。

3. Personalist dictatorships are probably bad for the economy  
3. 个人主义独裁政权可能对经济不利

The three most powerful countries in the world are now all ruled by strongmen. In China, Xi Jinping has subdued all rivals, and concentrated what used to be a dispersed bureaucratic oligarchy under his own personal [rule](https://substack.com/redirect/31cb2199-e820-4cfe-89d1-f055caa6e07a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA). In Russia, Putin is effectively an emperor. The U.S. is still officially a democracy, but democratic norms and institutions are eroding rapidly, and in April a majority of Americans called Trump a “dictator” [ https://substack.com/redirect/802c3dcb-9570-4e6d-aec8-3bef0fbda59d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA ].  
世界上最强大的三个国家现在都由强人统治。在中国，习近平已经压制了所有对手，将曾经分散的官僚寡头统治集中在他个人的[统治](https://substack.com/redirect/31cb2199-e820-4cfe-89d1-f055caa6e07a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)之下。在俄罗斯，普京实际上是一个皇帝。美国仍然官方上是一个民主国家，但民主规范和制度正在迅速侵蚀，四月份大多数美国人称特朗普为“独裁者”[ https://substack.com/redirect/802c3dcb-9570-4e6d-aec8-3bef0fbda59d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA]。

The question is what effect these personalistic regimes will have on the economy. China’s growth over the past four decades pretty much proves that democracy isn’t necessary for a strong or even dominant economy. But there’s a difference between countries ruled by a single strongman, and countries ruled by a system of elite institutions that distribute power among a number of oligarchs.  
问题是这些个人主义政权将对经济产生什么影响。中国在过去四十年的增长几乎证明了民主并不是强大甚至主导经济所必需的。但由单一强人统治的国家与由一套精英机构统治的国家之间是有区别的，这些机构在多个寡头之间分配权力。

A new paper by Blattman, Gehlbach, and [Yu](https://substack.com/redirect/5ad148ca-2752-4440-8608-dd245b8e8bfe?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) shows that personalist regimes tend to experience lower economic growth than either democracies or autocracies with more distributed power. The difference isn’t huge, but you can see it on a graph:  
Blattman、Gehlbach和[Yu](https://substack.com/redirect/5ad148ca-2752-4440-8608-dd245b8e8bfe?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)的一项新研究表明，个人主义政权的经济增长往往低于民主国家或权力更为分散的专制国家。差异并不大，但在图表上可以看到：

It’s not clear which direction the causation runs here; it could be that countries with bad economies tend to turn to strongmen to save them. But Blattman et al. test for this using variables that tend to predict regime transitions, and they don’t find any change. That implies that personalist regimes actually make mistakes that slow down economic growth.  
这里因果关系的方向并不明确；可能是经济不好的国家倾向于求助于强人来拯救他们。但Blattman等人使用倾向于预测政权转变的变量进行测试，并没有发现任何变化。这意味着个人主义政权实际上会犯错误，从而减缓经济增长。

Xi, Putin, and Trump certainly don’t exactly seem to be violating that rule of thumb. China’s growth has slowed relentlessly under Xi, and his industrial policy seems to be simply driving Chinese companies into [unprofitability](https://substack.com/redirect/b87eb2e9-ff2d-4e4b-86a1-9b01d45cefcd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) rather than extricating the country from its economic [slump](https://substack.com/redirect/ac158bf5-6ecb-4f8d-8525-8c982be7264d?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).
