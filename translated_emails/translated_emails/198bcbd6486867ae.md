This is a post about AI, whose proponents are downright messianic in describing it as the technology of the future. Maybe. But much of their advocacy seems to ignore some mundane limits to AI’s growth — limits I’ll try to illustrate by talking about a technology of the past.
I was probably 9 or 10 when my father took me to a Horn & Hardart automat. For those too young to remember — who I hope are a large fraction of my readers — these were establishments in which a variety of sandwiches and other foods were displayed behind glass doors. You would serve yourself by putting coins into a slot, which would unlock the door and let you extract your egg salad sandwich or whatever.
At the time (and at my age) it seemed wonderfully futuristic: Food service without people! In reality, of course, automats weren’t automated; each required a substantial staff to operate the kitchen and keep refilling those glass-doored compartments. And because automats weren’t all they pretended to be, they were eventually driven out of business by the rise of fast food.
Many applications of information technology are, like the automats of yore, less miraculous than they seem. True, the user experience makes you feel as if you’ve transcended the material world. You click a button on Amazon’s web site and a day or two later the item you wanted magically appears on your porch. But behind that hands-free experience lie a million-strong workforce and a huge physical footprint of distribution centers and delivery vehicles.
And the disconnect between the trans-material feel of the consumer experience and the physical realities that deliver that experience is especially severe for the hot technology of the moment, AI. We’re constantly arguing about whether AI is a bubble, whether it can really live up to the hype. We don’t talk enough about AI’s massive use of physical resources, especially but not only electricity.
And we certainly don’t talk enough about (a) how U.S. electricity pricing effectively subsidizes AI and (b) the extent to which limitations on generating capacity may nonetheless severely limit the technology’s growth.
How much generating capacity are we talking about? The Department of Energy estimates that data centers already consumed 4.4 percent of U.S. electricity in 2023, and expects that to grow to as much as 12 percent by 2028:
Source: Department of [Energy](https://substack.com/redirect/dda0cd72-e6e3-49e3-9995-1fca8cf96d4b?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)
AI isn’t the only source of rising electricity demand from data centers. There are other drivers including, alas, crypto — which still has no legitimate use case, but now has powerful political backing. But Goldman Sachs believes that AI will account for a large fraction of rising data center demand:

With Sam Altman of OpenAI promising to spend “[trillions](https://substack.com/redirect/7f00a863-1a97-49cb-8250-00aca3569c51?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)” on data centers in the near future — and sneering at economists who, he imagines, are wringing their hands — I wouldn’t be surprised to see demand come in at the high end of the Department of Energy’s projections. True, the AI bubble might burst before that happens, with potentially ugly consequences for the wider economy. But that’s a subject for another post.
So suppose that AI really does consume vast quantities of electricity over the next few years. Where are all those kilowatt-hours supposed to come from?
America is, of course, adding generating capacity as you read this, and can accelerate that expansion if it chooses to. But there are two big obstacles to any attempt to keep up with the demand from AI.
The first is that in recent years growth in U.S. generating capacity has become increasingly dependent on growth in renewable energy. According to S&P Global, almost 90 percent of the generating capacity added in the first 8 months of 2024 came from solar and wind:
Source: S&P [Global](https://substack.com/redirect/d29d99ed-e434-4304-9901-fff4ce748710?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)
Why is this a problem? Because Donald Trump and his minions have a deep, irrational hatred for renewable energy. Not only have they eliminated many of the green energy subsidies introduced by the Biden administration, they have been actively trying to [block](https://substack.com/redirect/ef1846e6-2d6c-4d61-b9f7-3a3f8f2a7dd3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) solar and wind projects.
So even as Trump promises to make America dominant in AI, he’s undermining a different cutting-edge technology — renewable energy — that is crucial to AI’s growth.
Suppose that electric utilities manage somehow to get around Trump’s anti-technology roadblocks and build the extra generating capacity. Who will pay for all that spending? The answer, given the way we regulate these utilities — and as natural monopolies, they must be regulated — is that the cost of adding capacity to power data centers is passed on to ordinary customers who have nothing to do with AI. This is already happening: Over the past 6 months retail electricity [prices](https://substack.com/redirect/740fed92-dc7f-4dd1-91cc-72c607769566?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) have risen at a 9 percent annual rate, four times as fast as overall consumer prices.
Last week the watchdog for PJM Interconnection LLC, the nation’s largest grid, declared that this must stop, that it “recommends that large data centers be required to bring their own [generation](https://substack.com/redirect/ce1ce46a-a792-4c91-ae20-e88e752f7d29?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).”
Indeed, requiring that the AI industry take responsibility for the costs it imposes makes a lot of sense. It would by no means end progress in AI. As the website Tech Policy [notes](https://substack.com/redirect/69744a8b-e780-4aab-8c46-820d3e6f0270?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA), there are many AI applications in which smaller, more focused models can perform almost as well as the bloated, all-in-one models currently dominating the field, while consuming far less energy. Until now there has been no incentive to take energy consumption into account, but there’s every reason to believe that we could achieve huge efficiency gains at very low cost.
But will we do the sensible thing? It’s obvious that any attempt to make AI more energy-efficient would lead to howls from tech bros who believe that they embody humanity’s future — and these bros have bought themselves a lot of political power.
So I don’t know how this will play out. I do know that your future electricity bills depend on the answer.

This is a post about AI, whose proponents are downright messianic in describing it as the technology of the future. Maybe. But much of their advocacy seems to ignore some mundane limits to AI’s growth — limits I’ll try to illustrate by talking about a technology of the past.  
这是一篇关于人工智能的文章，其支持者在描述它为未来技术时几乎是救世主般的。也许是这样。但他们的许多倡导似乎忽视了人工智能增长的一些平凡限制——我将通过谈论过去的一项技术来试图说明这些限制。

I was probably 9 or 10 when my father took me to a Horn & Hardart automat. For those too young to remember — who I hope are a large fraction of my readers — these were establishments in which a variety of sandwiches and other foods were displayed behind glass doors. You would serve yourself by putting coins into a slot, which would unlock the door and let you extract your egg salad sandwich or whatever.  
我大概在9或10岁时，我父亲带我去了一家Horn & Hardart自动餐厅。对于那些太年轻而无法记得的人——我希望他们是我读者中的大部分——这些地方展示了各种三明治和其他食物，都是放在玻璃门后面。你可以通过将硬币放入一个插槽来自助，这样就可以解锁门并取出你的蛋沙拉三明治或其他食物。

At the time (and at my age) it seemed wonderfully futuristic: Food service without people! In reality, of course, automats weren’t automated; each required a substantial staff to operate the kitchen and keep refilling those glass-doored compartments. And because automats weren’t all they pretended to be, they were eventually driven out of business by the rise of fast food.  
在那个时候（以及在我那个年龄），这看起来非常未来主义：没有人的食品服务！当然，实际上，自动餐厅并不是自动化的；每个餐厅都需要相当多的员工来操作厨房并不断补充那些玻璃门的隔间。而且，由于自动餐厅并不是它们所假装的那样，它们最终被快餐的崛起挤出了市场。

Many applications of information technology are, like the automats of yore, less miraculous than they seem. True, the user experience makes you feel as if you’ve transcended the material world. You click a button on Amazon’s web site and a day or two later the item you wanted magically appears on your porch. But behind that hands-free experience lie a million-strong workforce and a huge physical footprint of distribution centers and delivery vehicles.  
许多信息技术的应用就像往日的自动餐厅一样，看起来并没有那么神奇。确实，用户体验让你感觉自己超越了物质世界。你在亚马逊的网站上点击一个按钮，一两天后你想要的物品就神奇地出现在你的门廊上。但在这种免提体验背后，是一百万人的劳动力和巨大的配送中心及配送车辆的物理占地面积。

And the disconnect between the trans-material feel of the consumer experience and the physical realities that deliver that experience is especially severe for the hot technology of the moment, AI. We’re constantly arguing about whether AI is a bubble, whether it can really live up to the hype. We don’t talk enough about AI’s massive use of physical resources, especially but not only electricity.  
消费者体验的超物质感与提供这种体验的物理现实之间的脱节，在当前热门技术——人工智能中尤其严重。我们不断争论人工智能是否是一个泡沫，它是否真的能兑现炒作。我们对人工智能对物理资源的巨大需求（尤其是电力）讨论得还不够。

And we certainly don’t talk enough about (a) how U.S. electricity pricing effectively subsidizes AI and (b) the extent to which limitations on generating capacity may nonetheless severely limit the technology’s growth.  
我们当然也没有足够讨论（a）美国电价如何有效地补贴人工智能，以及（b）发电能力的限制在多大程度上可能仍然严重限制技术的增长。

How much generating capacity are we talking about? The Department of Energy estimates that data centers already consumed 4.4 percent of U.S. electricity in 2023, and expects that to grow to as much as 12 percent by 2028:  
我们在谈论多少发电能力？美国能源部估计，数据中心在2023年已经消耗了4.4%的美国电力，并预计到2028年这一比例将增长到12%：

So suppose that AI really does consume vast quantities of electricity over the next few years. Where are all those kilowatt-hours supposed to come from?  
那么假设人工智能在接下来的几年里确实消耗了大量电力。这些千瓦时到底来自哪里？

America is, of course, adding generating capacity as you read this, and can accelerate that expansion if it chooses to. But there are two big obstacles to any attempt to keep up with the demand from AI.  
美国当然在你阅读这篇文章时正在增加发电能力，如果选择的话可以加速这种扩张。但有两个主要障碍阻碍着任何试图跟上人工智能需求的努力。

The first is that in recent years growth in U.S. generating capacity has become increasingly dependent on growth in renewable energy. According to S&P Global, almost 90 percent of the generating capacity added in the first 8 months of 2024 came from solar and wind:  
第一个障碍是近年来美国发电能力的增长越来越依赖于可再生能源的增长。根据标准普尔全球公司的数据，2024年前8个月新增的发电能力中几乎90%来自太阳能和风能：

Why is this a problem? Because Donald Trump and his minions have a deep, irrational hatred for renewable energy. Not only have they eliminated many of the green energy subsidies introduced by the Biden administration, they have been actively trying to [block](https://substack.com/redirect/ef1846e6-2d6c-4d61-b9f7-3a3f8f2a7dd3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) solar and wind projects.  
这为什么是个问题？因为唐纳德·特朗普及其追随者对可再生能源有着深刻而非理性的仇恨。他们不仅取消了拜登政府推出的许多绿色能源补贴，还积极试图[阻止](https://substack.com/redirect/ef1846e6-2d6c-4d61-b9f7-3a3f8f2a7dd3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)太阳能和风能项目。

So even as Trump promises to make America dominant in AI, he’s undermining a different cutting-edge technology — renewable energy — that is crucial to AI’s growth.  
因此，即使特朗普承诺让美国在人工智能领域占据主导地位，他却在削弱另一项尖端技术——可再生能源——而这对人工智能的增长至关重要。

Suppose that electric utilities manage somehow to get around Trump’s anti-technology roadblocks and build the extra generating capacity. Who will pay for all that spending? The answer, given the way we regulate these utilities — and as natural monopolies, they must be regulated — is that the cost of adding capacity to power data centers is passed on to ordinary customers who have nothing to do with AI. This is already happening: Over the past 6 months retail electricity [prices](https://substack.com/redirect/740fed92-dc7f-4dd1-91cc-72c607769566?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA) have risen at a 9 percent annual rate, four times as fast as overall consumer prices.  
假设电力公司以某种方式设法绕过特朗普的反技术障碍并建设额外的发电能力。谁来支付所有这些开支？根据我们对这些公用事业的监管方式——作为自然垄断，它们必须受到监管——答案是，增加供电数据中心的能力的成本将转嫁给与人工智能无关的普通客户。这已经在发生：在过去的6个月里，零售电力[价格](https://substack.com/redirect/740fed92-dc7f-4dd1-91cc-72c607769566?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)以9%的年率上涨，速度是整体消费者价格的四倍。

Last week the watchdog for PJM Interconnection LLC, the nation’s largest grid, declared that this must stop, that it “recommends that large data centers be required to bring their own [generation](https://substack.com/redirect/ce1ce46a-a792-4c91-ae20-e88e752f7d29?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA).”  
上周，PJM Interconnection LLC（美国最大的电网）的监管机构宣布，这必须停止，他们“建议大型数据中心必须自备[发电](https://substack.com/redirect/ce1ce46a-a792-4c91-ae20-e88e752f7d29?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)。”

Indeed, requiring that the AI industry take responsibility for the costs it imposes makes a lot of sense. It would by no means end progress in AI.

Until now there has been no incentive to take energy consumption into account, but there’s every reason to believe that we could achieve huge efficiency gains at very low cost.  
确实，要求人工智能行业对其施加的成本负责是非常有意义的。这绝不会终止人工智能的进步。正如网站Tech Policy所[指出](https://substack.com/redirect/69744a8b-e780-4aab-8c46-820d3e6f0270?j=eyJ1IjoiMjBsbmJwIn0.KztYzEWpJOR2MnnIg5ijVYRyTJF67hinhCJnHuA6bbA)的那样，许多人工智能应用中较小、更专注的模型几乎可以与目前主导该领域的臃肿的全能模型一样出色，同时消耗的能量要少得多。到目前为止，没有动力考虑能源消耗，但有充分的理由相信我们可以以非常低的成本实现巨大的效率提升。

But will we do the sensible thing? It’s obvious that any attempt to make AI more energy-efficient would lead to howls from tech bros who believe that they embody humanity’s future — and these bros have bought themselves a lot of political power.  
但我们会做出明智的选择吗？显然，任何试图让人工智能更节能的努力都会引来那些相信自己代表人类未来的科技兄弟们的抗议——而这些兄弟们已经为自己赢得了很多政治权力。

So I don’t know how this will play out. I do know that your future electricity bills depend on the answer.  
所以我不知道这将如何发展。我确实知道，你未来的电费账单取决于这个答案。
