The widely watched Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment took a tumble last week. This came after a disappointing jobs report on Aug. 1, when Donald Trump decided the best policy move was to shoot the messenger by firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It was a doubly self-defeating move: the bad news moved to the top headlines, as well as undermining the credibility of any future Trump-appointed replacement.
In any case, between signs of an economic slowdown and growing evidence that tariffs as well as deportations are pushing up prices, I’m definitely hearing more buzz about the possibility of stagflation — a term that, I recently learned, was coined in Britain in the 1960s. So this seems like a good time to write a primer about what stagflation is, how it affects people’s lives, why it is a particularly hard problem for policymakers to address — and why the risks of long-term stagflation, which we have avoided for many decades, are once again looking serious.
Beyond the paywall, I’ll address the following:
1. The stagflations that were — and the stagflations that weren’t
2. The logic of stagflation
3. Why Bidenomics didn’t cause stagflation
Part II, which will be posted next week, will turn to Trumponomics and address the question of whether it will inflict stagflation on the American economy. In addition I will present some thoughts on how to track the economy if, as seems all too likely, the current administration begins suppressing and distorting data it doesn’t like...

The widely watched Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment took a tumble last week. This came after a disappointing jobs report on Aug. 1, when Donald Trump decided the best policy move was to shoot the messenger by firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It was a doubly self-defeating move: the bad news moved to the top headlines, as well as undermining the credibility of any future Trump-appointed replacement.  
备受关注的密歇根消费者信心指数上周大幅下跌。这发生在8月1日一份令人失望的就业报告之后，当时唐纳德·特朗普决定最佳的政策举措是通过解雇劳工统计局局长来“射杀信使”。这是一个双重自我挫败的举动：坏消息登上了头条，并且削弱了未来特朗普任命的替代者的可信度。  

In any case, between signs of an economic slowdown and growing evidence that tariffs as well as deportations are pushing up prices, I’m definitely hearing more buzz about the possibility of stagflation — a term that, I recently learned, was coined in Britain in the 1960s. So this seems like a good time to write a primer about what stagflation is, how it affects people’s lives, why it is a particularly hard problem for policymakers to address — and why the risks of long-term stagflation, which we have avoided for many decades, are once again looking serious.  
无论如何，随着经济放缓的迹象和关税以及驱逐令推高价格的证据越来越多，我确实听到了更多关于滞涨可能性的讨论——我最近了解到，这个术语是在1960年代的英国创造的。因此，现在似乎是写一篇关于滞涨是什么、它如何影响人们生活、为什么它对政策制定者来说是一个特别难以解决的问题，以及我们几十年来一直避免的长期滞涨风险为何再次显得严峻的入门文章的好时机。  

Beyond the paywall, I’ll address the following:  
在付费墙之外，我将讨论以下内容：  

1. The stagflations that were — and the stagflations that weren’t  
   1. 曾经存在的滞涨与不存在的滞涨  
2. The logic of stagflation  
   2. 滞涨的逻辑  
3. Why Bidenomics didn’t cause stagflation  
   3. 为什么拜登经济学没有导致滞涨  

Part II, which will be posted next week, will turn to Trumponomics and address the question of whether it will inflict stagflation on the American economy. In addition I will present some thoughts on how to track the economy if, as seems all too likely, the current administration begins suppressing and distorting data it doesn’t like...  
第二部分将于下周发布，将转向特朗普经济学，并探讨它是否会给美国经济带来滞涨。此外，我还将提出一些关于如何跟踪经济的想法，如果当前政府开始压制和扭曲它不喜欢的数据，这似乎是非常可能的……
